//! The concurrent [`TokenBucket`] runtime around the pure
//! [`plan_consume`](krabka_verified::throttle::plan_consume) arithmetic.
//!
//! This module holds the bucket's state, the lock that serializes every
//! update of it, and the injected [`MonotonicClock`].
//!
//! # Concurrency design
//!
//! The four values a consume reads and writes, `{rate, burst, available,
//! last_refill}`, live together in one [`BucketState`] behind one [`Mutex`].
//! [`TokenBucket::try_consume`] and [`TokenBucket::set_token_rate_with_burst`]
//! each hold that lock for their whole read-compute-write, so every consume and
//! every reset is one indivisible step on the group:
//!
//! * A reset can never land between a consume's reads and its writes, so a
//!   consume can never commit a balance computed under the old burst on top of
//!   the new one.
//! * A consume advances `last_refill` and adds the matching refill to
//!   `available` in the same critical section, so time a consume claims is
//!   always turned into tokens or capped away by the burst. It is never dropped.
//!
//! An earlier lock-free design sampled a seqlock generation, claimed the refill
//! with a compare-and-exchange on `last_refill`, re-checked the generation,
//! then committed `available` with a second compare-and-exchange. It had both
//! failures above: a whole reset could run between the generation re-check and
//! the commit and store a value equal to the one the commit expected, and a
//! failed commit threw away the refill its earlier claim had taken. Two words
//! cannot be committed by one `u64` compare-and-exchange, so the group takes a
//! lock. Kafka makes the same choice: `Sensor.record` updates its quota stats
//! inside `synchronized` blocks. The critical section is a clock read and a
//! few integer operations.
//!
//! # Sub-token accounting
//!
//! The group counts micro-tokens, [`MICROS_PER_TOKEN`] to a token, so a rate
//! that is not a whole number of tokens per second is enforced as configured.
//! Kafka holds every client quota as a double (`ClientQuotaManager` compares
//! the measured `Rate` with a `Quota` bound), so a `consumer_byte_rate` of
//! `0.5` must admit half a byte per second, not one and not an unlimited
//! stream. A whole-token caller is granted whole tokens and leaves any part
//! token in the bucket; [`TokenBucket::record`] charges the whole request and
//! keeps the part token in the debt it reports, for a caller that turns the
//! debt into a throttle delay.
//!
//! # Debt
//!
//! [`TokenBucket::record`] is Kafka's `Sensor.record` on a quota `Rate`: the
//! value is recorded whether or not the balance covers it, and what the balance
//! could not cover is debt. The refill repays the debt before it adds to the
//! balance, so the throttle a caller derives from it, `debt / rate`, carries
//! everything the client has sent above its bound. A grant-limited consume
//! that clamped at zero would credit the overage back through the refill of the
//! mute, and a client would send about twice its quota. `try_consume` grants
//! nothing while the bucket is in debt. A change of rate keeps the balance and
//! the debt (Kafka's `updateQuotaMetricConfigs` swaps the bound and leaves the
//! recorded samples); only a bucket that had no rate starts full.
//!
//! One value is read outside the lock. `micro_rate_per_sec` mirrors the
//! locked rate, and it is written only while the lock is held, so the unthrottled
//! fast path in `try_consume` and [`TokenBucket::token_rate`] skip the lock.
//! A fast-path read that sees `0` takes effect at that read, which orders the
//! consume before any reset that is still in flight. A non-zero read proves
//! nothing: the consume takes the lock and re-reads the rate there.
//!
//! The stateright model in `tests/bucket_model.rs` checks this design, and
//! shows that the lock-free design it replaces breaks both properties.
//!
//! The bucket's own operations live in submodules that each add an
//! `impl TokenBucket` block: [`self::rate`] holds the rate and burst
//! accessors together with the reset that publishes them, and
//! [`self::consume`] holds `try_consume`. [`self::state`] holds the
//! broker-wide [`ThrottleState`] bundle.
