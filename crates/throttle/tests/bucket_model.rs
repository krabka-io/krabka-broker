//! Exhaustive stateright interleaving model of the `krabka_throttle::TokenBucket`
//! concurrency, stepped one shared-memory access at a time.
//!
//! # What is modeled
//!
//! The state is the bucket's shared group `{rate, burst, available,
//! last_refill}`, the fast-path rate mirror, the lock, a clock, a dedicated
//! resetter thread, and a program counter per consumer thread. Each action is
//! one access to shared memory, in the order production makes it; values a
//! thread read earlier travel in its program counter. A `Tick` advances the
//! clock by one unit at any point, so a consumer's clock reading can be stale
//! by the time it acts on it.
//!
//! Two algorithms are modeled:
//!
//! * [`Algorithm::Locked`] is production. A consumer reads the rate mirror
//!   without the lock and grants a rate-0 request there. Otherwise it takes the
//!   lock, reads the clock, stores the claimed `last_refill`, stores
//!   `available`, and releases. A reset takes the lock, reads the clock, stores
//!   the group, publishes the mirror, and releases.
//! * [`Algorithm::SeqlockCas`] is the lock-free design production used before.
//!   A consumer reads the rate, then the seqlock generation (spinning while it
//!   is odd), the rate and the burst, the clock, and `last_refill`, then claims
//!   the refill with a compare-and-exchange on `last_refill`, reads
//!   `available`, re-checks the generation, and commits `available` with a
//!   second compare-and-exchange. Any failure restarts from the generation
//!   read. A reset makes the generation odd, stores rate, burst, `available`,
//!   and `last_refill` one at a time, and makes the generation even again.
//!   The runs over it are RED witnesses: they must find its two bugs.
//!
//! # Driven and modeled
//!
//! DRIVEN: the production cap-and-grant arithmetic,
//! [`krabka_verified::throttle::plan_consume`], and the whole-token request
//! cut, [`krabka_throttle::whole_token_request`], at every commit.
//!
//! MODELED: one clock unit is one second and every quantity is in the
//! bucket's storage unit, `units_per_token` to a token; production stores
//! micro-tokens. Every rate is a whole number of storage units per second, so
//! a refill is `elapsed * rate` and a consume claims the whole elapsed gap.
//! Production's part-unit remainder is covered by the unit tests in
//! `src/runtime/consume.rs`. A consume asks for whole tokens and is granted
//! whole tokens, so with `units_per_token > 1` a rate or a burst of a
//! fraction of a token leaves part tokens in the bucket, as production does
//! under a fractional quota rate. Memory is sequentially consistent: the
//! model checks the protocol, not the atomic orderings, and `Locked` needs no
//! ordering beyond what the lock gives.
//!
//! # Properties
//!
//! The ghost state records, for the configuration in force since the last
//! reset, the reset's clock reading `t0`, the tokens granted, and the tokens
//! the burst capped away. Both safety properties are checked whenever no reset
//! is part-way through its stores; a seqlock reader never acts on such a
//! state, and under the lock nobody can see one.
//!
//! * `available_within_burst`: `available <= burst`.
//! * `grants_whole_tokens`: every grant in the configuration is a whole
//!   number of tokens, even when the bucket holds a part token.
//! * `claimed_refill_conserved`: `available + granted + capped + in_flight ==
//!   burst + rate * (last_refill - t0)`. The right side is every token the
//!   configuration has made available: its initial burst plus the refill for
//!   all the time consumers have claimed. `in_flight` is the refill a consumer
//!   has claimed time for in this configuration but not committed yet. The
//!   equation fails if a claimed refill vanishes (tokens lost) or if a commit
//!   adds tokens the configuration never made (tokens over-granted).
//!
//! Reachability witnesses show that consumers overlap, a reset overlaps a
//! consume, a claimed refill is in flight, a refill is granted and another is
//! capped, a reset shrinks the burst, and the bucket drains.
//!
//! # Runs
//!
//! `bucket_basic`, `bucket_wide` and `bucket_fractional` check `Locked`
//! exhaustively and pin their unique-state counts. `bucket_fractional` runs
//! at two storage units to a token, so its rates and bursts are half tokens. The RED runs check `SeqlockCas` in the smallest search
//! that shows each bug, and `locked_holds_where_seqlock_cas_fails` checks
//! `Locked` in the same searches. Two scripted schedules replay each bug step
//! by step, and show that the lock disables the same interleaving.
//!
//! An earlier version of this model made the generation check and the
//! `available` write one atomic step, tied the burst to the rate, blocked a
//! consume from starting while a reset ran, and claimed the refill with a swap
//! on an abstract `pending` counter. It could not reach either bug, and
//! production shipped both.
