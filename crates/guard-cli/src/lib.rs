//! Administers krabka topic write freezes and break-glass proposals.
//!
//! A write freeze is a broker-owned state where the cluster is up, every read
//! works, and the broker refuses every new client write to a topic. A
//! break-glass proposal is a standing authorization that two different people
//! agreed to, which a privileged transition spends. This is the operator's side
//! of both: freeze a scope, read the registry back and prove it, lift a freeze
//! with an approval, and open, approve, withdraw and read the proposals.
//!
//! It is one command for one incident. It is a library as well as a binary so
//! tests call [`run_from_args`] in process: a test that spawns the binary needs
//! a Cargo working tree to build it from, and a Bazel test sandbox has none.
//! That is the same reason `krabka-barrier` and `krabka-format` are libraries.
//!
//! # The two properties that matter
//!
//! `--sign-with` never leaves the machine. It takes a PKCS#8 Ed25519 key file,
//! builds the canonical signing bytes here, signs them here, and puts only the
//! `key_id` and the detached signature on the wire. The private key never
//! reaches a broker, so a broker cannot make a signature in an operator's name.
//!
//! `freeze list --verify-signatures` checks the registry here as well, against
//! operator public keys on this machine. That makes the operator's own machine,
//! and not the broker that served the rows, the thing that says the registry is
//! authentic.
//!
//! # Exit codes
//!
//! A runbook branches on `$?`, so every number means one thing across this tool
//! and `krabka-barrier`. See [`EXIT_REFUSED`], [`EXIT_UNREACHABLE`],
//! [`EXIT_MISMATCH`], [`EXIT_NO_APPROVAL`] and [`EXIT_BAD_SIGNATURE`].
//!
//! # The api keys
//!
//! Every subcommand speaks one krabka-private api key, in the 1015 to 1019
//! range. A JVM `AdminClient` cannot send those. The freeze is visible to the
//! JVM tools another way: `DescribeConfigs` reports a read-only `write.freeze`
//! key for every topic, so `kafka-configs --describe` shows it.
