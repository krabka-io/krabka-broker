//! The command line this tool accepts, and the values its arguments resolve to.

//! `clap` derives the parser from these types, so the doc comment beside a

//! parser can state on its own: `--topic` against `--prefix`, and the three

//! value, and it refuses the combination the parser already rules out rather
//! than falling back to a default that would mean something else.
