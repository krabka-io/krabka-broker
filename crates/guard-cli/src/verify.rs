//! Proves the freeze registry against operator public keys on this machine.
//!
//! `freeze list --verify-signatures` reads the registry from a broker and then
//! checks every entry here, against a trust set on the operator's own disk.
//! That is what makes the operator's laptop, and not the broker that served the
//! rows, the thing that says the registry is authentic. A broker that minted a
//! record naming somebody else cannot make a signature to go with it, because
//! the signing key never reached it.
//!
//! # What a proof is worth
//!
//! A verified entry proves authorship. It proves that the person the entry
//! names authored that entry, for that scope, in that cluster, at that time. It
//! does not prove that any broker then refused a write, which is a different
//! kind of evidence that the produce-path tests supply.
//!
//! # The mixture
//!
//! `freeze.require_signature` is off by default, because a freeze is the safe
//! direction and an operator has to reach it in one command on a cluster where
//! nobody installed key material yet. So a registry can hold proved entries and
//! attested ones side by side. An attested entry carries no signature, and the
//! broker's word is all that stands behind it.
//!
//! This is what `--verify-signatures` separates, so an unsigned entry is
//! reported as unsigned rather than counted as a failure. An operator who wants
//! the mixture gone sets `freeze.require_signature = true` on the brokers.
//!
//! # Three outcomes, not two
//!
//! An entry that names a `key_id` the local trust set does not hold is not the
//! same as an entry whose signature is wrong. The first says the tool could not
//! check. The second says the tool checked and the answer is wrong. KFC-5's
//! verifier draws the same line, and the caller turns the two into different
//! exit codes.
