//! What a capture writes beside its artifacts, and the check that reads it
//! back.
//!
//! A capture is a directory of opaque bytes: an operator cannot look at a
//! controller checkpoint and tell whether it arrived whole. The manifest is
//! what makes the copy checkable — it names every artifact with the size and
//! the SHA-256 of the bytes that were uploaded, so `krabka-backup verify` can
//! answer the only question that matters before a disaster, which is whether
//! this copy would restore.
