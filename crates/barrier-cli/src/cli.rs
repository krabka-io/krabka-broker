//! The tool's command line: the `clap` types and the argument conversions.

//! `Cli` and `Command` spell every flag each barrier subcommand takes, and
//! `parse_time` and `as_millis_i64` are the two halves of the one conversion
//! the wire forces: an operator writes a duration in whatever unit reads best,
//! and the barrier apis carry milliseconds. Parsing is separate from sending
//! so a test can prove a command line reaches the right shape without a
