//! Runtime control of the stdout log filter, which is what Kafka's
//! `BROKER_LOGGER` config resource alters.
//!
//! A JVM broker keeps a live log4j2 `LoggerContext`. `kafka-configs
//! --entity-type broker-loggers --describe` reads every logger out of it, and
//! `--alter` writes one logger's level back into it. Neither call touches
//! cluster metadata: the change lives in the node that served the request and
//! is gone when that node restarts. This module is the same thing for
//! `tracing`.
//!
//! ## The model
//!
//! [`LogLevelController`] owns one editable [`EnvFilter`] behind a lock and
//! the *model* it was rendered from: a root level and a per-target level map.
//! Every level change mutates the model, re-renders it into a fresh
//! `EnvFilter`, swaps it in, and rebuilds the callsite interest cache so a
//! level *raise* takes effect at callsites `tracing` had already cached as
//! disabled. Mutation, render and swap happen under one lock, so a describe
//! never reports a level the live filter does not yet carry, and two
//! concurrent alterations cannot install their filters in the opposite order
//! from their model edits.
//!
//! The directives the model cannot express — a span or field directive such
//! as `[my_span{field=1}]=debug` — go into a second `EnvFilter` that is built
//! once and never replaced. `EnvFilter` keeps the state of the spans a
//! dynamic directive matches inside itself, and that state cannot be
//! transplanted into a new filter, so a rebuild would silence the events
//! inside a span that was already open. A callsite is enabled when either
//! filter enables it, which is exactly how one `EnvFilter` combines its
//! dynamic and static directives.
//!
//! [`LogLevelFilter`] is the [`Filter`] side of the same state. It delegates
//! to the carried filter and to whichever editable `EnvFilter` is current,
//! and records the target of every callsite it is asked about, which is how
//! the controller learns that a logger exists. `tracing` offers a new
//! callsite to every registered subscriber, so the recorded set covers the
//! whole process and not only the layer this filter is attached to. Together
//! with the targets the starting spec names, it answers to log4j2's
//! `LoggerContext.getLoggers()` plus the loggers a `log4j2.properties`
//! declares: a name stays a logger once it is known, whatever its level is
//! later set to or cleared back to.
//!
//! ## Levels
//!
//! Kafka's `LogLevelConfig.VALID_LOG_LEVELS` is `FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO,
//! DEBUG, TRACE`. `tracing` has no `FATAL`, so [`LogLevel::Fatal`] renders as
//! the `off` directive: no krabka event is more severe than `ERROR`, so a
//! target held at `FATAL` emits nothing, which is exactly what log4j2 does
//! with the same setting. The mapping round-trips, so a `FATAL` an operator
//! writes is the `FATAL` the describe reads back.
