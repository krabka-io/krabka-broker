//! Shared Kafka-ACL authorization evaluator (broker + gateway).
//!
//! This crate holds the [`Authorizer`] trait, the ACL evaluator
//! ([`SimpleAclAuthorizer`] and [`AllowAllAuthorizer`]), and an [`AclSource`]
//! abstraction. One evaluator therefore serves both the broker and the gateway.
//! The broker passes a `MetadataImage` snapshot. The gateway passes an
//! [`AclCache`] over a `Vec<AclEntry>` that it fetched with `DescribeAcls`.
//!
//! The decision logic lives here once, so the two callers can never drift. That
//! logic covers the super-user bypass, deny-wins, and operation implication.
//!
//! ## Authorizing a request
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::net::SocketAddr;
//!
//! use krabka_authz::{AllowAllAuthorizer, AuthorizationRequest, AuthorizationResult, Authorizer};
//! use krabka_metadata::{AclOperation, MetadataImage, ResourceType};
//! use krabka_security::{AuthMethod, Principal};
//! use uuid::Uuid;
//!
//! let image = MetadataImage::new(Uuid::nil());
//! let principal = Principal {
//!     name: "alice".into(),
//!     auth_method: AuthMethod::SaslPlain,
//!     groups: vec![],
//! };
//! let host: SocketAddr = "127.0.0.1:9092".parse().unwrap();
//! let req = AuthorizationRequest {
//!     principal: &principal,
//!     host: &host,
//!     resource_type: ResourceType::Topic,
//!     resource_name: "orders",
//!     operation: AclOperation::Read,
//! };
//!
//! assert2::assert!(AllowAllAuthorizer.authorize(&image, &req) == AuthorizationResult::Allow);
//! ```
