//! The command and inbound vocabulary that drives one turn of the engine loop.
//!
//! [`Command`] is everything that arrives on the engine's mpsc: an inbound peer
//! RPC ([`Inbound`]), an injected core [`Event`], a decoded Fetch or
//! `FetchSnapshot` response, a [`TimerTick`], or a handle-facing operation. The
//! reply payloads that those handle ops carry back, [`MetadataFetchSlice`] and
//! [`QuorumStateSnapshot`], live here with them.
