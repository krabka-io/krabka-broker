//! Controller activation: the records that a new leader writes to a metadata
//! log that holds no `metadata.version`.
//!
//! Kafka's active controller writes them in its `CompleteActivationEvent`,
//! with `ActivationRecordsGenerator.recordsForEmptyLog`. They are the
//! bootstrap records, from the bootstrap checkpoint of a dynamic format or
//! else from the `bootstrap.checkpoint` of a static one, and the cluster-level
//! `min.insync.replicas` when the bootstrap records enable ELR. A broker never
//! writes them. Every replica, a broker-only observer too, applies them from
//! the log. A controller that cannot write them stops over a fatal fault, as
//! Kafka's `fatalFaultHandler` halts the process.
