//! Metadata log cleaning by retention: Kafka's `KafkaRaftLog.maybeClean`.
//!
//! A snapshot does not move the log start by itself. The engine keeps every
//! snapshot, and the log prefix they cover, until `metadata.max.retention.bytes`
//! or `metadata.max.retention.ms` lets the oldest snapshot go. Then the oldest
//! snapshot is deleted, the log start moves up to the next snapshot, and every
//! segment wholly below the new log start is deleted. The newest snapshot
//! always stays, so a node with fewer than two snapshots cleans nothing.
//!
//! The size rule runs first and the age rule second, as in Kafka. Each walks
//! the snapshots from the oldest and stops at the first one it keeps.
