//! Kafka's guard against replaying a feature level this controller does not
//! support.
//!
//! `FeatureControlManager.replay(FeatureLevelRecord)` looks the feature up in
//! the controller's own supported features and throws when the record's level
//! lies outside that range:
//!
//! ```text
//! Tried to apply FeatureLevelRecord ..., but this controller only supports versions <range>
//! ```
//!
//! The exception is fatal, so a controller never runs at a level that it did
//! not advertise. That is what protects a cluster whose log finalized an
//! unstable `metadata.version` from a node that started with
//! `unstable.feature.versions.enable` off. A feature the controller does not
//! know is supported at level 0 only, as `QuorumFeatures.localSupportedFeature`
//! answers `DISABLED`, the range `0-0`, for it: a log that finalized a feature
//! from a newer release at any level above 0 is refused, and the message names
//! the range as `0`.
//!
//! Kafka's fatal fault halts the process (`ProcessTerminatingFaultHandler`,
//! exit status 1). A library does not halt its host, so the controller
//! reports the fault and the embedder halts. A controller that starts over such
//! a log refuses to start with a [`RaftError::FatalFault`](crate::RaftError),
//! and one that applies such a level from its leader stops itself: it publishes the
//! refusal on [`ControllerHandle::watch_fatal`](crate::ControllerHandle), then
//! cancels the listener and the engine, and every later submit fails with
//! [`RaftError::Shutdown`](crate::RaftError). A combined broker turns that
//! signal into a failed `Broker::start` or, once started, into its
//! self-shutdown, and `krabka-broker` exits non-zero with the refusal, so the
//! process never runs on without its controller.
//!
//! The engine applies a record and publishes the resulting image, so the guard
//! reads the finalized levels of a published image: the one the engine
//! recovered at start-up, and each one it publishes afterwards. The image keeps
//! the last level of each feature, so a record that a later record superseded
//! is not named. Kafka would name it, and refuses the same logs.
