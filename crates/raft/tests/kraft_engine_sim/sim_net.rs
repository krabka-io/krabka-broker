//! The in-memory network the simulated engines talk over: a registry of live
//! engines keyed by node id, and the [`PeerSender`] that routes an encoded
//! KIP-595 body into the target engine's inbound queue.
//!
//! Registering and removing an engine is how the acceptances model a node
//! booting, crashing, and coming back; partitioning and healing one is how they
//! model a node that keeps running while the network cuts it off. The whole
//! notion of reachability in this simulation lives here.
