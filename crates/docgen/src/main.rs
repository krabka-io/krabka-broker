//! The `krabka-docgen` command line.
//!
//! `all` writes the generated reference tree. `snippets` rewrites the fenced
//! code blocks of the checked-in markdown from the source regions they name.
//! CI runs `snippets` in place and fails when the working tree changes, so a
//! source edit that a documentation page quotes cannot land on its own.
