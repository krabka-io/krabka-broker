//! Bounded Stateright model of audit-spool append, replay, crash recovery, and
//! loss accounting.
//!
//! DRIVEN: every spool append, a record's or a loss marker's, calls the
//! production `spool_append_decision` kernel used by `Spool::append`. `Reopen`
//! calls the production `replay_recovery` classifier used by `Spool::open`.
//! `Lose` calls the production `add_loss_state` helper used by
//! `PendingLosses::add`. `CommitLossMarker` and the loss reconciliation in
//! `Reopen` call the production `settle_loss_batch` kernel that
//! `PendingLosses::commit` and `PendingLosses::reconcile` apply.
//!
//! MODELED: filesystem writes are split into volatile and durable records;
//! `Sync` publishes all completed appends; `Crash` drops volatile and torn
//! writes; replay poison, sink delivery, cursor persistence, and poison removal
//! are separate actions. A poison at the current cursor makes `Reopen` stop for
//! explicit recovery, before loss reconciliation, as `Spool::open` returns
//! early. A poison behind the cursor is cleared.
//!
//! The loss path is `PendingLosses` as the writer drives it. A lost event adds
//! to the in-memory count, from the writer or concurrently from
//! `AuditHandle::emit`. `PersistLosses` writes the sidecar. The writer's
//! `persist_with` is one step per call it makes: take the snapshot, persist the
//! sidecar, append the marker (a spool record, subject to the spool's capacity),
//! sync it, commit in memory, and persist the commit. Only a concurrent loss or
//! a crash can fall between two of those steps, because the writer is serial.
//!
//! `superseded_settlement_loses_and_rereports_losses` keeps the settlement
//! `PendingLosses` applied before `settle_loss_batch` (the commit left a
//! remainder in the marker's generation, and reconcile zeroed the count) and
//! records the counterexamples the checker finds for it.
//!
//! Bounds: three record IDs, two loss events, a two-record spool, sync cadence
//! two, at most two crashes, and depth 64. Properties require every admitted
//! record to be delivered or durably pending, at-most-once automatic delivery,
//! and exact loss accounting: every loss is reported by exactly one durable
//! marker, still pending, or was held only in memory at a crash. Reachability
//! witnesses cover torn append recovery, definite replay retry, uncertain
//! replay poison, committed-poison cleanup, a marker refused by a full spool,
//! loss-marker reconciliation, and a concurrent loss carried past a marker.
