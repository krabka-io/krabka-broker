//! Formats the log directories of a krabka broker node.
//!
//! A `KRaft` node will not boot against an unformatted directory: the broker
//! treats one as operator error and aborts startup. Formatting seeds Kafka's
//! `meta.properties`, the bootstrap records, and the singleton `VotersRecord`,
//! and can provision seed SCRAM credentials at the same time. One run formats
//! every directory of the node, as `kafka-storage format` does, and writes the
//! cluster and directory ids in Kafka's 22-character base64 form.
//! `docs/format-divergences.md` in the repository lists where the command
//! differs from `kafka-storage format`, and why.
//!
//! [`MetaProperties`] reads and writes `meta.properties` byte for byte as
//! Kafka does. The broker reads the file through it, and so can any tool that
//! has to find the identity of a formatted directory.
//!
//! [`run_with_records`] takes further [`MetadataRecord`]s from the caller and
//! seeds them into the same stream. A restore tool that rebuilds a cluster from
//! tiered-storage archives hands over the topic and partition records it
//! recovered that way, and the broker then boots with those topics present.
//!
//! This is the `krabka format` command from the monorepo's `krabka-cli`. That
//! crate also drives the gres layer, which is why it could not follow the broker
//! into this repository; the command itself needs only [`krabka_metadata`] and
//! [`krabka_security`]. It is a library as well as a binary so `krabka-cli` can
//! call it rather than carry a second copy.
