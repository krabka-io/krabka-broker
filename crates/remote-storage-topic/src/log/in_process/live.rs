//! The broadcast-side filter that decides which live record reaches one
//! subscription's stream.
//!
//! A record passes only when its partition is currently assigned and its
//! offset is at or after that partition's cursor. A partition added mid-stream
//! is marked `via_inject`, so its passing records are re-routed into the
//! subscription's FIFO instead of being emitted here, which keeps them behind
//! the backlog that [`AssignmentHandle::add`] already queued.
