//! [`TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager`]: the production
//! [`RemoteLogMetadataManager`](krabka_remote_storage::RemoteLogMetadataManager)
//! implementation backed by a publish and subscribe [`MetadataEventLog`].
//!
//! The manager keeps the canonical in-memory view in an
//! [`InmemoryRemoteLogMetadataManager`], so the lifecycle state machine is the
//! single source of truth for cache mutation. It uses the
//! [`MetadataEventLog`] as the durable event log.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!
//! - [`TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager::start`][]: load any on-disk
//!   snapshot into the cache and spawn the consumer pump subscribed to
//!   NOTHING. The broker then drives the consumed set with
//!   [`TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager::reconcile_assignment`]. That call
//!   adds only the `__remote_log_metadata` partitions that cover the
//!   user-partitions this broker leads or follows. `NotReady` gates a
//!   newly-added partition until the pump reaches the HWM observed at
//!   assignment time. A partition this broker does not consume is a genuine
//!   `Ok(None)`, and the manager never serves it from any stale cache.
//! - Mutation calls, which are `add`, `update`, and `put_partition_delete`:
//!   serialize, publish, and wait until the consumer pump has applied
//!   the published offset to the inner cache. The sync return means
//!   "the event has been recorded and is visible to local reads".
//! - Read calls: pure local lookups against the inner cache.
//! - Drop / [`TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager::shutdown`]: cancel the consumer pump.
