//! `krabka-worm-verify` — verify a WORM archive with read-only credentials.
//!
//! The auditor runs this against a bucket or a directory with no broker and no
//! cluster: everything it checks is written into the archive. It reads the
//! per-segment manifests, recomputes the partition hash chain, checks every
//! signature against a key the auditor supplies, and confirms that every object
//! a manifest names is present with the recorded size. `--deep` additionally
//! re-hashes every object body.
//!
//! Credentials come from the ambient AWS chain. There is deliberately no
//! `--access-key` flag: an auditor should hold a read-only role, not a copy of
//! the writer's keys.
