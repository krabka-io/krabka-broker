//! What one manifest's signature is worth to a verification run.
//!
//! The check is separate from the chain walk because it grades three outcomes
//! the walk treats differently: a manifest with no signature and a manifest
//! signed by an untrusted `key_id` are counted and the diagnostic walk
//! continues, but its report cannot be `ok`; a signature that fails against a
//! trusted key stops the walk.
