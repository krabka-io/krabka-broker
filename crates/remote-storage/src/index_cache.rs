//! `RemoteIndexCache` keeps a bounded on-disk copy of the index objects a
//! remote segment carries, so a consumer reading through a cold segment
//! downloads each index once instead of once per `Fetch`.
//!
//! Mirrors Kafka's `RemoteIndexCache`
//! (`org.apache.kafka.storage.internals.log.RemoteIndexCache`): entries live
//! under `<log_dir>/remote-log-index-cache`, are keyed by the segment's
//! [`RemoteLogSegmentId`](crate::RemoteLogSegmentId) together with the
//! [`IndexType`], and the cache is sized by a total-byte budget
//! (Kafka's `remote.log.index.file.cache.total.size.bytes`, 1 GiB by default)
//! rather than by entry count, because a `.txnindex` and a `.timeindex` differ
//! in size by orders of magnitude. Reaching the budget evicts the
//! least-recently-used entries until the new one fits.
//!
//! The cache directory is emptied on construction. This is a cache of bytes
//! that the remote tier still holds, so a restart re-downloading them costs
//! latency and nothing else, whereas trusting files written by an earlier
//! process would mean trusting a size budget and a segment lineage that the
//! new process cannot check. Kafka reloads its directory; krabka does not,
//! because krabka has no on-disk entry header to validate one against.
//!
//! [`RemoteIndexCache::disabled`] is the pass-through the broker's in-process
//! tests and the [`RemoteReader`]-equivalent unbounded path use: every lookup
//! is a miss and nothing is written.
//!
//! Eviction is also driven from the segment lifecycle:
//! [`RemoteIndexCache::remove_segment`] drops every index of one segment when
//! the `RemoteLogManager` moves it to
//! [`DeleteSegmentStarted`](crate::RemoteLogSegmentState::DeleteSegmentStarted),
//! so a deleted segment's bytes do not hold the budget against live segments.
//!
//! [`RemoteReader`]: https://docs.rs/krabka-broker
