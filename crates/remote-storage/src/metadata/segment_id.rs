//! Identity types for a remote log segment.
//!
//! [`TopicIdPartition`] names a partition by its stable topic UUID, and
//! [`RemoteLogSegmentId`] pairs that partition with the random per-segment
//! UUID that makes one segment globally unique. Both are pure identity, which
//! is why they sit apart from the metadata record that carries them.
