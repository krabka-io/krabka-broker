// The `Compact` action converges many append/tick paths onto shared logs, so the
// BFS's *generated* count (`state_count()`) runs ~2-2.5x the *unique* count. We
// therefore bound exhaustiveness on the two metrics that actually matter:
//
//   * `TARGET_STATE_COUNT` — the stateright truncation target. Set high so the
//     BFS runs to *completion* on the configs below; `state_count() < TARGET`
//     after `.join()` then certifies the run was exhaustive (it stopped because
//     the frontier emptied, not because it hit the target). The 3 GB host memory
//     watchdog (see `[[feedback_bound_model_checkers]]`) is the other runaway
//     guard — never run this unguarded.
//   * `MAX_UNIQUE_STATES` — the memory-proportional bound (resident memory ∝
//     distinct states). At the bounds below the unique space is ~144k (basic) /
//     ~1.10M (wide), generated ~0.7M / ~5.5M, and resident memory stays well
//     under 1 GB.

// The exact unique-state count of the exhaustive BFS over each config below.
// `unique_state_count()` is deterministic for a fixed model, so pinning it
// turns any change to the reachable set -- a dropped action, a `next_state` arm
// that starts returning `None`, a derived `Hash`/`PartialEq` that stops
// considering a field -- into a failure instead of a silently smaller search
// that still passes the upper bound. The *generated* count is deliberately not
// pinned: it depends on dedupe timing across the BFS worker threads.
//
// The state carries `last_pass`, the log the most recent `Compact` consumed, so
// that the pass rules are `always` properties with counterexample paths. Every
// `(log, clock)` a `Compact` leaves behind is therefore reached once per
// distinct input, which roughly doubled the counts (66,831 and 459,869 before).
