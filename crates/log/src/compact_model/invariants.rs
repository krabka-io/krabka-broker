//! The five KIP-534 safety rules one compaction pass must obey, stated over the
//! pass's input log, its output log and the clock it ran at.
//!
//! Every rule is computed from the two logs alone. None of them calls the
//! production cores or reads bookkeeping from the pass, so a pass cannot
//! satisfy a rule by construction: the rules are the specification the pass is
//! checked against.
//!
//! A pass may only delete entries and stamp a horizon on an entry that has
//! none, so its output must be an order-preserving subsequence of its input
//! under that one permitted rewrite. [`Invariant::IdempotentStamp`] checks that
//! shape. The retention rules each name the input entries a pass must *not*
//! delete, and hold when those entries appear, in order, in the output. See
//! [`retains`]. The two checks are independent, so a pass that breaks one rule
//! is reported against that rule alone.
