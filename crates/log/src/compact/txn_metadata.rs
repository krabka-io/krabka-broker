//! The transaction state a compaction pass carries while it walks the log.
//!
//! This is Kafka's `CleanedTransactionMetadata`. It tracks the aborted and
//! committed transactions the cleaner has met so far, so the pass can tell
//! which data batches belong to an aborted transaction, which markers may age
//! out, and which aborted-transaction entries the rewritten `.txnindex` has to
//! carry. Both passes drive it in offset order, the offset-map pass and the
//! rewrite pass, each with an instance of its own.
