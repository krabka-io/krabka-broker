//! Crash-safe promotion of a compaction's survivor segment over the segments
//! it replaces. It is the only step of compaction that mutates the live
//! segment file set, so it is kept apart from the passes that only read and
//! write scratch files.
//!
//! The protocol, and the recovery that finishes it after a crash, are
//! described in [`crate::recovery::swap`].

///      log to `.log.swap` and `fsync` the directory. The durable `.log.swap`
///      commits the swap.
///   3. Delete every file of every consumed segment, and `fsync` the

///   4. Rename the log to its final name and `fsync` the directory, then the
///      sidecars, and `fsync` the directory.
