//! Log compaction primitives. These are almost-pure helpers that work on
//! [`Segment`] handles and the on-disk file layout. [`crate::Log::compact`]
//! uses them.
//!
//! The algorithm makes a single pass over the **sealed** segment list, from
//! oldest to newest. It builds a key-to-latest-offset map, then rewrites the
//! surviving records into a single new segment at the lowest input base
//! offset. It never touches the active segment. Both walks track the
//! transactions they meet with a [`CleanedTransactionMetadata`], so a batch of
//! an aborted transaction never wins the map and never survives the rewrite.
//!
//! The algorithm drops records with `key.is_none()`, as Kafka's `LogCleaner`
//! does. A tombstone is a record with `key.is_some()` and `value.is_none()`.
//! The algorithm treats a tombstone like any other value and keeps it as the
//! most-recent entry for its key. `delete.retention.ms` ages tombstones out.
