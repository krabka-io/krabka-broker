//! An active segment that writes through `O_DIRECT`.
//!
//! Under `preallocate`, the active segment writes its batches through a
//! second, `O_DIRECT` handle on its `.log` file and keeps the newest of them in
//! memory, so they reach the disk without passing through the page cache, and
//! a consumer reading right behind the producer still reads from memory. The
//! buffered handle stays: reads, `sendfile`, `fsync` and every truncate go
//! through it, and the kernel keeps the two coherent.
//!
//! A direct write must cover whole blocks, so the file runs up to a block
//! past its last batch while the segment is active: the [`DirectWriter`]
//! zero-pads the partial last block and rewrites it on the next append. The
//! padding goes when the segment stops writing directly -- at the seal, when
//! `preallocate` is turned off, and when the segment is dropped. A crash
//! leaves it, and tail recovery cuts it as it cuts any bytes that do not
//! decode as a batch, which is what Kafka's own `preallocate` leaves behind.
