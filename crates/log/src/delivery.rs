//! Deliver-at-time visibility: when a scheduled batch becomes readable.
//!
//! On a topic set to [`DeliveryPolicy::Scheduled`](crate::DeliveryPolicy), a
//! record batch is not visible the moment it is durable. It becomes visible
//! once its activation time has passed. The activation time is the batch's
//! `max_timestamp`, the v2 header field, so a producer schedules delivery
//! through the timestamp it stamps and no sidecar is needed.
//!
//! The schedule lives entirely in the records, which is why nothing here is
//! persisted. A watermark is derived state: after a restart or a leader
//! change it is recomputed from the segments, and a recomputation can only
//! agree with what the records say.
