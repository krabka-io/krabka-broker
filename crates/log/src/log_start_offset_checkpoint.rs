//! Per-partition `log-start-offset-checkpoint` file: the durable record of a
//! log start that segment names alone cannot express.
//!
//! A trim that lands on a segment boundary survives a reopen on its own,
//! because the segments below it are gone and the first surviving base offset
//! *is* the log start. A trim that lands inside a segment has no such witness:
//! the records below it are still in the file, and without this checkpoint a
//! reopened log serves them again. Apache Kafka keeps the same value in a
//! `log-start-offset-checkpoint` per log dir, keyed by partition, written by
//! `LogManager.checkpointLogStartOffsets` and read back by `UnifiedLog`.
//! krabka writes one file per partition directory instead, which is the layout
//! `leader-epoch-checkpoint` already uses here and needs no topic/partition key
//! inside the file.
//!
//! The format is the checkpoint-file family's version header followed by the
//! offset:
//!
//! ```text
//!   0          <-- header version
//!   <offset>   <-- log start offset
//! ```
//!
//! Kafka's row count has no counterpart: a per-partition file holds exactly one
//! value.
