//! What `preallocate` asks of the disk, and what it leaves on it.
//!
//! [`SegmentAllocation::Preallocate`] reserves a segment's blocks before its
//! first append and gives back the rest when it is sealed. A
//! reservation is invisible to a reader, so the cases here watch it two ways:
//! through a [`LogIo`] that records each request, which says exactly what the
//! log asked for, and on Linux through the blocks a real file holds, which
//! says the kernel did it.
