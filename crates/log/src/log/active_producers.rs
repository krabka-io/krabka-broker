//! The producer state that `DescribeProducers` reports and that log compaction

//!
//! Kafka keeps one producer state for each partition log. Every replica
//! updates it for each batch that it appends: a leader for a client batch, and
//! a follower for a batch that it replicates. `ReplicaManager
//! .activeProducerState` answers `DescribeProducers` from that state on every
//! replica that hosts the partition, through `Partition.activeProducerState`
//! and `UnifiedLog.activeProducers`. The log cleaner of every replica reads the
//! same state: `Cleaner.cleanSegments` takes `UnifiedLog
//! .lastRecordsOfActiveProducers`. `ProducerStateManager
//! .removeExpiredProducers` removes a producer when `producer.id.expiration.ms`
//! has passed since its last write and it has no open transaction.
