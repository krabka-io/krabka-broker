//! What a compaction pass keeps for the producers of the log.
//!
//! Kafka's `Cleaner.cleanSegments` reads the last record of each active
//! producer from the producer state of the log
//! (`UnifiedLog.lastRecordsOfActiveProducers`), and `Cleaner.cleanInto` keeps
//! that record, as an empty batch when compaction removes all of its records.
//! Every append path updates the producer state, so a leader, a follower and a
//! follower that appends verbatim keep the same batches.
