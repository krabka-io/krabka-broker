//! KIP-890 part 1: the per-producer verification state that ties a
//! transactional append to a transaction the coordinator knows.
//!
//! Before a transactional batch starts a transaction on this partition, the
//! broker asks the transaction coordinator to verify (or, with transaction
//! version 2, to add) the partition. The log hands out a
//! [`VerificationGuard`] when that check starts and keeps it until the next
//! transactional append or end marker of the producer. An append must present
//! the same guard. A marker that lands between the check and the append clears
//! the guard, so a stale check can never start a transaction the coordinator
//! already ended.
//!
//! This is Kafka's `VerificationStateEntry`, `VerificationGuard`,
//! `UnifiedLog.maybeStartTransactionVerification` and the
//! `batchMissingRequiredVerification` check in
//! `UnifiedLog.analyzeAndValidateProducerState`.
