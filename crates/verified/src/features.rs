//! Feature-finalization admission for one `UpdateFeatures` row.
//!
//! The decision follows Kafka 4.3.1's `FeatureControlManager.updateFeature`
//! check for check: the upgrade type, a negative level, every node's support
//! (`reasonNotSupported`), the update direction against the current level
//! (an unfinalized feature reads as level 0), and then the per-feature tail:
//! `updateMetadataVersion`'s `didMetadataChange` refusal for
//! `metadata.version`, the no-downgrade rule for `kraft.version`, and
//! `Feature.validateVersion`'s KIP-1022 dependencies for every other feature.
