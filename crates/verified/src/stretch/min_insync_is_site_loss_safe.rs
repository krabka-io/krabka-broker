/// they sit. If one site can hold `min_insync` of them, then the in-sync set
/// can shrink to that one site, and the leader then acknowledges a write that
/// only that site holds. The loss of that site loses an acknowledged write,
/// and the surviving sites still hold the voter majority, so they elect a
/// leader that never saw it. The shrink needs no second site loss to get
/// there: one site down and one lagging replica is enough, and a witness on a
/// cheap link is the replica most likely to lag.
///
/// The **upper** bound is that the loss of any one site leaves at least
/// `min_insync` replicas, so the leader keeps accepting `acks=all` writes. The
/// fewest that a site loss leaves is [`site_loss_survivors`].
///
/// The lower bound implies `min_insync >= 2`, because one site always holds at
/// least one replica. It is therefore the whole of the durability condition,
/// and 2 is not stated separately.
///
/// For three replicas on three sites each site holds one, so the bounds are
/// `min_insync > 1` and `min_insync <= 2`: they meet, and 2 is the only safe
/// value. Four replicas on three sites have no safe value at all, because one
/// site holds two of them: the bounds become `min_insync > 2` and
/// `min_insync <= 2`. Three replicas on two sites have none either, for the
/// same reason. A witness site closes that gap. It holds a replica of its own,
/// so three replicas spread one per site over three sites again.
