//! Uniform group-assignor kernels (KIP-848 `UniformAssignor`).
//!
//! Kafka's server-side `UniformAssignor`
//! (`org.apache.kafka.coordinator.group.assignor`) picks one of two builders.
//! `UniformHomogeneousAssignmentBuilder` runs when every member subscribes to
//! the same topics, and `UniformHeterogeneousAssignmentBuilder` runs
//! otherwise. Both rank balance ahead of stickiness, and neither consults
//! replica racks. This module holds the two decisions that the builders make
//! about members: the quota each member gets in the homogeneous builder, and
//! the least-loaded subscriber that receives an unassigned partition in the
//! heterogeneous builder. The host in `krabka-broker` owns the partition
//! bookkeeping around them.
