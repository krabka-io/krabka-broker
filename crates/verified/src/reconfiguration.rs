//! `KRaft` voter-reconfiguration admission and result shape.

//! The decision follows the order in which Kafka's `KafkaRaftClient`,
//! `AddVoterHandler`, `RemoveVoterHandler`, `UpdateVoterHandler`, and
//! `LeaderState.maybeAppendUpgradedKRaftVersion` reject a request, and it
//! admits a change only while KIP-853's one-change-at-a-time rule holds: the
//! node leads, its epoch is committed, no earlier change is pending, and no
//! control record is uncommitted.
