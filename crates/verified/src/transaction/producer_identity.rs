/// What an `InitProducerId` caller's producer identity may do to the entry it
/// names (KIP-360).
///
/// A request producer id of `-1` supplies no identity, which every
/// `InitProducerId` below v3 and every first initialisation does.
///
/// Kafka admits a supplied identity in `TransactionCoordinator`'s
/// `isValidProducerId`: the identity names the entry's producer id, whatever
/// its epoch, or it names the producer id from before the last rotation
/// together with an exhausted epoch. The epoch then decides the outcome in
/// `TransactionMetadata.prepareIncrementProducerEpoch`: the entry's own epoch
/// bumps it, the epoch before the last bump is a retry of that bump, and
/// every other epoch is fenced.
///
/// The retry rule also covers a failed epoch fence: that path records the
/// epoch the producer still holds as the last epoch, so the producer that
/// owns the transaction is the one the rule admits.
///
/// Kafka's `isValidProducerId` has a third admission clause, which this
/// kernel does not model: `txnMetadata.producerEpoch ==
/// RecordBatch.NO_PRODUCER_EPOCH` admits every supplied identity, and
/// `prepareIncrementProducerEpoch` then bumps. Only the metadata that
/// `handleInitProducerId` has just created for an unknown transactional ID
/// carries that epoch. The host covers the clause: it answers a transactional
/// ID with no entry by allocating a fresh identity without calling this
/// kernel, and every entry it does pass here has a nonnegative epoch, because
/// allocation hands out nonnegative epochs and
/// [`crate::transaction::transaction_pid_install_decision`] rejects a replayed entry with a
/// negative current or staged epoch.
