/// Classify an incoming batch against a producer's tracked entry and the
/// sequence ranges of the batches it retains.
///
/// This is Kafka's `UnifiedLog.analyzeAndValidateProducerState` for a client
/// append. It first looks the batch up among the retained batches
/// (`ProducerStateEntry.findDuplicateBatch`): at the entry's epoch, a batch
/// whose base sequence and last sequence (`base_sequence + last_offset_delta`
/// modulo `2^31`) equal a retained batch's is a duplicate of the first such
/// batch. `None` slots never match. Only a batch that repeats no retained
/// batch goes on to `ProducerAppendInfo.checkProducerEpoch` and
/// `checkSequence`:
///
/// - a producer with no entry can start at any sequence, except that under
///   `trunk_rules` it must start at sequence 0 on a partition whose log is
///   empty (`log_empty`) and is otherwise out of order;
/// - a lower epoch is fenced;
/// - a higher epoch must start at sequence 0 and is otherwise out of order;
/// - the same epoch must continue at the last sequence plus one modulo `2^31`
///   and is otherwise out of order.
///
/// The empty-log rule is Kafka trunk's (KAFKA-15591, in
/// `ProducerAppendInfo.checkSequence`); Kafka 4.3.1 does not have it.
/// `log_empty` is Kafka's `ProducerStateManager.mapEndOffset() == 0`: no
/// record has ever been appended to the partition, so no producer state can
/// have been lost, and `trunk_rules` says whether the host serves Kafka
/// trunk's behaviour.
///
/// The host supplies the retained batches at the entry's epoch; a batch at
/// any other epoch never matches them.
