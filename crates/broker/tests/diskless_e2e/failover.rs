//! An `acks=all` diskless append survives the loss of the broker that acked it.
//!
//! This is the subsystem's whole value proposition, and it is the one claim
//! that a single-broker or single-process test cannot make. The case asserts
//! three separate things, in this order, because each one is a different way
//! the claim could be false:
//!
//! 1. **A second voter's durable checkpoint advanced.** Bytes can sit in a
//!    file the voter would discard on recovery. The checkpoint is what makes
//!    a prefix survive a restart, so it has to have moved to cover the acked
//!    range and no further.
//! 2. **That voter holds the bytes.** Read out of the broker's own
//!    `__diskless_wal_quorum` tree, byte for byte against what the leader
//!    serves. A local fsync on the leader would satisfy the produce path and
//!    fail here.
//! 3. **The promoted broker serves the same offsets byte for byte.** Not "the
//!    same number of records" and not "the same values": the same batches --
//!    and served from the WAL replica, because both survivors' ordinary
//!    partition logs are emptied first. See the comment on that truncation for
//!    why it is needed and what it does not fully close.
