//! A broker crashes mid-flush and comes back.
//!
//! A diskless flush is a multi-step commit: build the object from the
//! committed tails, PUT it, publish the index record naming it, wait for that
//! record to be projected, then trim the local logs behind the frontier. A
//! crash can land between any two of those steps, and each gap leaves a
//! different half-state -- an object nothing points at, an index record whose
//! local prefix is still present, a trim that only got half way through the
//! partitions.
//!
//! The invariant that has to hold across all of them is the only one that
//! matters to a producer: an offset that was acknowledged is still readable.
//! The case acknowledges a known prefix, then keeps a second producer writing
//! and waits until a whole flush cycle has run against that load, so the
//! crash lands on a cycling pipeline rather than on an idle broker between two
//! ticks. It then kills the broker without a controlled shutdown, brings it
//! back on the same addresses, and requires the whole acknowledged prefix
//! back.
//!
//! It does not pin the crash to a chosen step of the cycle -- see the comment
//! on the gate below for why that needs a fault hook the suite does not add.
//! The invariant is asserted because it must hold at every step.
//!
//! Only that prefix is asserted on. How many of the churn records were
//! acknowledged is decided by exactly when the crash landed, so asserting on
//! them would be asserting on the timing rather than on the invariant.
