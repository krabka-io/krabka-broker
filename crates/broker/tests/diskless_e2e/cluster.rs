//! The three-broker cluster every case in this suite runs on: its boot, the
//! readiness waits that gate the first produce, and the crash-and-restart the
//! fault-injection cases need.
//!
//! The boot is specific enough to sit apart from the cases that drive it. A
//! diskless quorum needs three things a plain `start_n_node` cluster does not
//! give it. Every broker needs a **distinct rack**, because
//! `wal::quorum::placement` refuses to weaken the AZ-loss failure budget and
//! returns a short voter list when two candidates share one. Every broker
//! needs the **same object store**, because a flush written by one broker is
//! read back by another. Every broker needs a **topic-backed metadata log**,
//! because the WAL flush index is a Kafka topic the whole cluster consumes.
//! And every broker needs an **authenticated inter-broker listener**, because
//! a WAL follower's Fetch is authorized against the caller's principal: the
//! leader resolves it to a node id and serves the shard only to a voter that
//! is who it claims to be, so an anonymous follower is refused and a
//! plaintext cluster would never form a quorum at all.
