//! Flush, trim, then read a trimmed offset back out of the object store.
//!
//! The WAL quorum keeps a committed prefix on local disks only until the
//! flusher has moved it into the object store and the index record naming it
//! has been committed and projected. After that the local logs are trimmed and
//! the only copy of those offsets is the flushed object.
//!
//! What makes this a real cold read, and not an accidental local hit, is the
//! assertion that the partition's log start has actually passed the offset
//! being fetched. Below the log start there is nothing left to serve locally,
//! so `OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE` is the only answer the log path can give and the
//! object store is the only thing that can rescue it.
