//! Tests 3 to 6: the leader-side throttle caps the bytes a replica Fetch
//! returns, an unthrottled partition is left alone, a list that names only the
//! follower throttles nothing, and a follower in the ISR is never throttled.
//!
//! All run on the PLAINTEXT cluster: the throttle decision is made on the
//! fetch path and needs no principal, so the compat shim that allows every
//! operation while there are no ACLs keeps the setup to the minimum. They are
//! the tests that give the suite its name — the config tests only prove the key
//! round-trips, these prove it is enforced.
