//! Cluster fixtures: bringing up the single broker each test runs against, in
//! either its `SASL_PLAINTEXT` or its PLAINTEXT flavour, plus topic creation
//! and the wait that absorbs raft commit latency.
//!
//! The suite needs both listener flavours — the config tests want a named
//! principal, the fetch tests only want the shortest path to a leader — so the
//! two starters and their two matching `CreateTopics` drivers are collected
//! here rather than duplicated per test module.
