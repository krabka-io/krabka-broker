//! A test-only TCP relay that simulates a network partition between brokers.
//!
//! # Why a relay exists
//!
//! Broker integration tests speak real loopback TCP, and a broker builds its
//! outbound dialer internally from its own config (see `broker.rs`), so a test
//! cannot slot a fault-injecting transport underneath it without a production
//! change made solely for tests. The raft crate's simulation harness does have
//! a partition/heal injector, but it works on raft events inside one process
//! and never touches a socket, so it cannot fault the broker-level links.
//!
//! A relay closes that gap from the outside. Bind a listener on loopback, tell
//! the brokers that their peer lives *there*, and forward every byte on to the
//! peer's real address. Cutting the relay is then indistinguishable, from the
//! broker's point of view, from the peer becoming unreachable.
//!
//! # Why this is not the same as stopping a broker
//!
//! A stopped broker and a partitioned-away broker are different failures, and
//! only the second one leaves a *live* minority that can misbehave — accept a
//! write it should refuse, or elect a second leader. A test that shuts a broker
//! down cannot observe any of that, because the suspect node is not running.
//! The relay leaves every node running and takes away only the network.
//!
//! # Tearing down connections that are already open
//!
//! [`Relay::cut`] must do two things, and the second is the subtle one:
//!
//! 1. stop forwarding *new* connections, and
//! 2. tear down the connections that are *already open*.
//!
//! Blocking only new connections is not a partition. Brokers hold long-lived
//! replication and heartbeat connections, so a "partitioned" node whose
//! established sockets keep working would go on replicating, the test would
//! pass, and it would have proved nothing.
//!
//! So every forwarding task holds a *link token* — a [`CancellationToken`] that
//! stands for one healthy generation of the link — and selects on it while it
//! copies. `cut` cancels that token, which wakes every in-flight copy at once;
//! each task then returns, dropping both of its sockets, and both endpoints see
//! their connection close. [`Relay::heal`] installs a fresh generation, because
//! a cancelled token never un-cancels.
//!
//! The token is kept in a `std::sync::Mutex`, which is the simplest thing that
//! is correct here. It is *both* the state flag the accept loop reads
//! (`is_cancelled`) and the wake-up that aborts the copies, so one field does
//! both jobs: an `AtomicBool` would need a second mechanism to interrupt the
//! copies, and a `watch` channel would need every connection task to hold a
//! receiver and match on values. The lock is held only long enough to clone or
//! replace a token, never across an `.await`, so a blocking mutex cannot stall
//! the runtime — and being blocking is what lets `cut`/`heal` take `&self` and
//! stay callable from synchronous code holding an `Arc<Relay>`.
//!
//! Each link token is a *child* of the relay's shutdown token, so cancelling
//! the shutdown token also aborts every in-flight copy, without `shutdown`
//! having to reach for the link.
//!
//! # What a cut looks like on the wire
//!
//! While cut, the relay stays bound and accepts an inbound connection, then
//! immediately drops it. That is the simplest way to make a connection attempt
//! *fail* rather than hang: the dialer's handshake completes but its first read
//! ends at once, so the broker sees a dead peer and retries, which is what a
//! real partition looks like to it. A silently ignored connection would instead
//! leave the dialer blocked until its own timeout, which is slower and looks
//! like a hang rather than a partition.
//!
//! # Ports
//!
//! The relay binds `127.0.0.1:0` and reads back the assigned port, and it keeps
//! that listener for its whole life. It therefore has none of the bind-and-drop
//! TOCTOU problem that `super::bind_and_hold_ports` exists to solve: the port is
//! never released for a concurrently running test binary to steal, because it is
//! never released at all until the relay shuts down. There is nothing to "fix"
//! here.
