//! The rejection scenario: a classic group that still has a live member, static
//! or dynamic, must refuse the `StreamsGroupHeartbeat` with
//! `GROUP_ID_NOT_FOUND` (69) and stay Classic-typed.
//!
//! The scenario parks a `JoinGroup` on its own connection to hold the member
//! live, which is why it does not reuse the full `classic_join_sync` driver and
//! lives apart from the conversion scenario.
