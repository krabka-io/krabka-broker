/// The name on an approval is the broker's word for it, and the whole point of
/// the signature is that the record stays provable without trusting the broker
/// that minted it. Three outcomes have to stay apart, and this case pins all
/// three: no signature is `OPERATOR_SIGNATURE_REQUIRED` (1010), a signature
/// that does not verify is `OPERATOR_SIGNATURE_INVALID` (1009), and a good one
/// is accepted and stored. The bytes are built in this file from the layout
/// KFC-9 documents, so the pass also proves the broker rebuilds the same bytes.
