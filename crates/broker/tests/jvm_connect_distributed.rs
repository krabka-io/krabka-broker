//! A Kafka Connect worker in DISTRIBUTED mode, against krabka.
//!
//! Standalone mode keeps its offsets in a local file and never speaks to a
//! coordinator, so it exercises nothing this suite is about. Distributed mode
//! backs all three of its stores -- config, offset and status -- with
//! `KafkaBasedLog`, and that is a specific contract on the broker:
//!
//! - `TopicAdmin` creates the three topics with `cleanup.policy=compact` and
//!   `CreateTopics`, treating `TOPIC_ALREADY_EXISTS` as success;
//! - each log reads its end offsets with `Admin.listOffsets`, then replays the
//!   topic from `seekToBeginning` to that offset before the worker will serve;
//! - every write goes through an idempotent producer (`acks=all`,
//!   `enable.idempotence=true`), so `InitProducerId` and the producer-id
//!   sequencing are on the startup path, not an optional extra;
//! - the `DistributedHerder` itself is a classic consumer group under the
//!   `connect` protocol, so `JoinGroup`/`SyncGroup` carry the worker's own
//!   assignment userdata.
//!
//! The worker is the stock `connect-distributed` of
//! `mirror.gcr.io/apache/kafka:4.3.1`. That image is JRE-only, which is fine
//! here -- nothing is compiled -- and its tarball carries both
//! `bin/connect-distributed.sh` and `libs/connect-file-*.jar`, so no new image
//! is pinned for this suite. `kafka-run-class.sh` deliberately excludes
//! `connect-file*.jar` from the worker classpath, so the jar is copied into a
//! `plugin.path` directory instead of being picked up from `libs`.
//!
//! The suite registers a `FileStreamSource` and a `FileStreamSink` over one
//! topic through the REST API, and then asserts the round trip: the worker
//! reports both connectors and their tasks `RUNNING`, the sink file ends up
//! matching the source file byte for byte, and the three internal topics exist
//! on krabka with `cleanup.policy=compact`.
//!
//! The REST calls are made from the test over a published port with a small
//! HTTP/1.1 client rather than with `curl` inside the container: the image is
//! Alpine with nothing but `bash` added, so no HTTP client is guaranteed to be
//! in it.
//!
//! Gated `#[ignore = "requires Docker"]`; the Bazel `docker` lane runs it with
//! `--ignored --test-threads=1`.
