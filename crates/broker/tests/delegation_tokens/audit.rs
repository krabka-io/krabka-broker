//! The audit trail a delegation-token mutation leaves behind.
//!
//! `CreateDelegationToken`, `RenewDelegationToken` and `ExpireDelegationToken`
//! each have to reach the audit topic as an OCSF `AdminOperation` record that
//! names the token they changed. Two of those three are only auditable at all
//! because the broker resolves the token id from the metadata image *before*
//! the mutation: renew and expire address a token by HMAC, neither response
//! echoes an id back, and an expire removes the record the lookup would read.
//!
//! The record names the id and never the HMAC. The HMAC is the token's
//! password equivalent, and the audit topic is a place an auditor reads.
//!
//! These cases need the `SASL_PLAINTEXT` fixture rather than the in-process
//! one the rest of the audit suite uses: the four delegation-token apis are
//! gated on `delegation_token_secret_key`, and they authorize against the
//! connection's own principal rather than against a request context.
