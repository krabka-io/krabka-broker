//! `MirrorMaker 2` (KIP-382), out of the stock Apache image, mirroring a Kafka
//! cluster onto krabka.
//!
//! # Why this suite exists
//!
//! Nobody adopts a Kafka-compatible broker greenfield. They adopt it by
//! mirroring the cluster they already run onto it and cutting their consumers
//! over, and MM2 is the one tool the ecosystem uses for that. The migration
//! path onto krabka is therefore exactly as good as one MM2 run against it,
//! and this suite is that run: the stock `connect-mirror-maker.sh` of
//! `mirror.gcr.io/apache/kafka:4.3.1`, with a stock broker of the same release
//! as the source cluster and krabka as the target.
//!
//! `tests/jvm_connect_distributed.rs` already holds the Connect half of this
//! against that image -- the three `KafkaBasedLog` stores, the idempotent
//! producer on the startup path and the `connect` classic-protocol group. What
//! MM2 adds is the part a migration turns on:
//!
//! - the `heartbeats`, `<source>.checkpoints.internal` and
//!   `mm2-offset-syncs.<alias>.internal` topics, all three created through
//!   `MirrorUtils.createSinglePartitionCompactedTopic`;
//! - `Admin.listConsumerGroupOffsets` on the source and
//!   `alterConsumerGroupOffsets` on the target, which together are offset
//!   translation -- the one place a 99%-compatible broker silently loses or
//!   replays data, because a consumer cut over to the wrong offset either
//!   skips records or reads them twice and nothing reports an error;
//! - `describeConfigs` and `incrementalAlterConfigs` for `sync.topic.configs`;
//! - `describeAcls` and `createAcls` for `sync.topic.acls`.
//!
//! `docs/operations/migrate-from-kafka.md` is the procedure this run stands
//! behind.
//!
//! # How the two clusters are addressed
//!
//! Both are named by the Docker bridge gateway, which is the one address that
//! is routable from the host AND from every container on the default bridge:
//! `tests/jvm_kip320_divergence/docker.rs` established that shape for its
//! mixed cluster, for the same reason. The source broker publishes its
//! listener on a host port and advertises `<gateway>:<port>`; krabka listens
//! on the host and is told to advertise `<gateway>:<port>` rather than the
//! `host.docker.internal` name the rest of the JVM suites use. MM2 and every
//! admin tool then run in containers that name the two clusters exactly as the
//! test does. `--network host` is not used, for the reason
//! `tests/jvm_acceptance/mod.rs` writes down.
//!
//! # The MM2 settings this suite pins, and why none is a workaround
//!
//! - `replication.factor`, `checkpoints.topic.replication.factor`,
//!   `heartbeats.topic.replication.factor` and
//!   `offset-syncs.topic.replication.factor` are 1. MM2 defaults them to 2 and
//!   3, which a single-node target cannot open. That is the size of the
//!   cluster, not anything about krabka.
//! - `offset-syncs.topic.location=target` puts the offset-syncs topic on
//!   krabka. MM2 defaults it to the source, where it would be the stock
//!   broker's business and this suite would learn nothing from it.
//! - `offset.lag.max=0` makes MM2 emit an offset sync for every record. Under
//!   the default of 100 the sparse `OffsetSyncStore` translates
//!   conservatively -- an upstream offset with no exact sync becomes one past
//!   the nearest earlier sync's downstream offset -- so a translated position
//!   would be a range rather than a number, and the case below asserts a
//!   number.
//! - `sync.group.offsets.enabled=true`. MM2 defaults it off; it is the feature
//!   under test.
//!
//! `sync.topic.acls.enabled` and `sync.topic.configs.enabled` are left at
//! their defaults, both true. The ACL default matters here: the milestone that
//! landed this suite also made krabka answer the ACL RPCs `SECURITY_DISABLED`
//! (54) under its default `allow_all` authorizer, which is what a stock Kafka
//! with no `authorizer.class.name` answers. Because the source broker here
//! also has no authorizer, MM2's ACL sync stops at the source --
//! `MirrorSourceConnector` catches the source's `SecurityDisabledException`
//! from `describeAcls` and skips the sync -- so the target-side `createAcls`
//! is not reached from MM2 in this arrangement. The case therefore does two
//! things: it holds MM2's own log to having raised no ACL-sync failure, and it
//! makes the target-side call itself with `kafka-acls` and asserts krabka's
//! answer is the `SecurityDisabledException` a stock target would give. The
//! migration guide says what an operator whose source cluster *does* have an
//! authorizer sees.
//!
//! # What a failure here prints
//!
//! Every wait announces itself and its result as `KRABKA[test]`, so the log
//! says which of them the case reached without anyone waiting for it to fail,
//! and each one names itself again in its own failure. A wait also ends the
//! moment MM2's container stops, because every one of them is a wait on MM2
//! doing something.
//!
//! No container's log is inlined whole into a message. `log_excerpt` carries
//! the `ERROR`/`WARN` lines and the tail, a few KB, and `save_log` writes the
//! rest to `TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`. The first run of this suite inlined
//! MM2's whole log instead: GitHub's job-log API keeps roughly the last 470 KB
//! of a job, one dump filled it, and the suites sharded beside this one lost
//! their diagnostics along with this one's.
//!
//! The container-driven case is gated `#[ignore = "requires Docker"]`; the
//! Bazel `docker` lane runs it. The parsing this suite reads the JVM tools
//! with is covered by ordinary tests that need no daemon.
