//! The metadata-sharing proof itself: kill the partition leader and read every
//! record back from the survivor.
//!
//! The suite has exactly one test, and it is long because the scenario is: boot
//! three brokers, produce until segments tier, watch the follower evict its own
//! copy of what the leader tiered, wait for the follower's RLMM consumer to
//! catch up, shut the leader down, wait for the surviving quorum to elect the
//! follower, then consume from offset 0. The steps that stand on their own live
//! in the sibling modules; what remains here is the ordering between them and
//! the discriminating assertion, which must keep requiring every record back.

/// metadata replication. Broker 1 leads the rf=2 user partition and runs the
/// RLM copy task. Broker 2 only consumes `__remote_log_metadata` to learn the
/// segment locations, and uses that same metadata to evict its own local copy
/// of every tiered segment while broker 1 still leads. After broker 1 shuts
/// down, the surviving 2-out-of-3 quorum commits a new partition-leader
/// record, and broker 2 serves all records from the remote tier. That proves
/// the RLMM metadata-sharing claim.
///
/// The test runs under plain `cargo test`, with no Docker, no `MinIO`, and no
