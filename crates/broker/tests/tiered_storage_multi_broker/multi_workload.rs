//! The produce-side workload: creating the tiered topic, filling it until the
//! leader's copy task has tiered segments, counting what landed in the shared
//! remote directory, and watching the local eviction that follows on the
//! *follower's* disk.
//!
//! These steps all run before the leader is killed, and they are the only part
//! of the suite that writes anything. Keeping them together leaves the
//! failover test with a short setup and puts the `remote.storage.enable` /
//! `local.retention.bytes` configuration that makes the eviction happen in one
//! place, beside the two directory walks that observe it.
