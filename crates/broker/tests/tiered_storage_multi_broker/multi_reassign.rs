//! Adding a replica to a tiered partition whose local segments are gone.
//!
//! Growing or healing a storage-heavy cluster means moving tiered partitions
//! onto brokers that hold none of their history. KIP-405 says the new replica
//! must not be handed that history: the leader answers a follower fetching
//! into `[log_start, local_log_start)` with `OFFSET_MOVED_TO_TIERED_STORAGE`,
//! and the follower restarts its log at the leader's local log start. What the
//! new replica then pulls is bounded by the leader's *local* retention, not by
//! the size of the archive.
//!
//! Without that answer the leader serves the follower out of the tier, one
//! batch per fetch, exactly as it serves a consumer -- so every archived byte
//! is re-materialised on the new broker's disk at replication rate, through
//! the leader's bounded reader pool. This suite is what says that does not
//! happen: it archives a partition, evicts it locally, adds a replica, and
//! measures both what the new replica pulled over the wire and where its log
//! begins.
//!
//! The partition is assigned to broker 1 by hand. Broker 1 is the address
//! every broker's RLMM client bootstraps against, so it has to keep running
//! for any copy to complete; making it the leader keeps it running and keeps
//! brokers 2 and 3 free to be the replica this test adds.
