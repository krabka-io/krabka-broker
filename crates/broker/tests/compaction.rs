// rustc 1.95 clippy ICEs on this file in the same places as elect_leaders.rs:
// `clippy::pedantic` lints — annotate-snippets upstream bug.

//! Log compaction end-to-end broker integration test.
//!
//! The test produces 30 records across 3 keys, k1, k2, and k3, into a compacted
//! topic. It waits for a compaction pass, force-rolls the active segment, and
//! waits for another pass. It then fetches the records and asserts that exactly
//! 3 distinct keys survive with only their latest values, v10-kN. Old values
//! v0..v9 must be gone from the sealed segments.
//!
//! Gated to non-Windows to match the multi-broker test convention from
//! slices 10b/12b/14/15.
