//! Static membership (`instance_id`) in a streams group, as Kafka 4.3.1 serves
//! it: not at all.
//!
//! Kafka 4.3.1's `GroupCoordinatorService.streamsGroupHeartbeat` runs
//! `throwIfStreamsGroupHeartbeatRequestIsUsingUnsupportedFeatures` before it
//! schedules the write, and that check refuses any request with an instance id
//! with `INVALID_REQUEST` and "Static membership is not yet supported.". The
//! coordinator never sees the request, so it writes no record, creates no
//! group and changes no member. Its own static paths (`streamsGroupLeave` and
//! `streamsGroupHeartbeat`) throw `UnsupportedOperationException` and are
//! unreachable. The broker's default configuration serves 4.3.1.
