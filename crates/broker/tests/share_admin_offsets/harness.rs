//! Shared cluster and share-consume helpers for the KIP-932 admin offset suite.
//!
//! The helpers start a single-broker test cluster, create a topic, produce
//! records, drive `ShareGroupHeartbeat` membership, and reuse the shared
//! `ShareFetch` and `ShareAcknowledge` fixtures. The error-code and
//! acknowledgement-type constants live here as well, since every admin surface
//! in this suite asserts on them.
