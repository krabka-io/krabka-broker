//! Test for the restore of `delivery_complete_count` across a restart.
//!
//! The delivery complete count is Kafka's `SharePartition.deliveryCompleteCount`:
//! the number of Acknowledged and Archived records in the in-flight window at
//! or above the SPSO. Share-group lag is `end - start - count`, so a recovered
//! group that reset it to 0 would over-report its lag. The test lives apart
//! from the admin-RPC surfaces because it asserts on the recovered share-state
//! summary rather than on a Describe, Alter, or Delete response.
