//! A multi-hour soak: three brokers, continuous traffic, and a failure when a
//! resource level drifts rather than only when something crashes.
//!
//! # What this lane is for
//!
//! The longest a krabka cluster had ever run in this repository was the length
//! of one integration test -- the slowest wall-clock bound anywhere under
//! `crates/broker/tests` is four minutes -- and nothing in the workspace had
//! ever read a resource level and asserted a bound on it. So the failure a
//! Kafka operator actually hits, a broker that is fine for a day and then OOMs
//! or hits `EMFILE` on day three, was one this repository had no evidence
//! about, and one an adopter would discover in their production rather than in
//! ours.
//!
//! `docs/operations/capacity.md` tells that operator to size file descriptors
//! as "one per client connection plus the segment files of every replica" and
//! to watch `krabka_broker_active_connections`, which counts only the first
//! half of that sum. This suite is what makes the second half checkable:
//! segment-file handles, fetch-session cache entries, per-partition metric
//! series, producer-id state and the log directory itself all have to come back
//! down over hours of steady traffic, and here they are sampled and judged.
//!
//! # How it runs
//!
//! Three brokers, each a real container process out of `//packaging`'s image
//! and formatted into one three-voter quorum -- see [`cluster`] for the
//! addressing that lets containers and the host reach the same broker. Three
//! topics carry the load, and their configurations are the reason ten cycles of
//! each kind are reachable inside the run rather than a hope:
//!
//! | topic | policy | segment | retention | what it exercises |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `soak-retention` | `delete` | `segment.bytes=64 KiB`, `segment.ms=5s` | `retention.ms=60s`, `retention.bytes=4 MiB` | segment roll, then deletion of the sealed segments |
//! | `soak-compacted` | `compact` | `segment.bytes=64 KiB`, `segment.ms=5s` | `min.cleanable.dirty.ratio=0.01`, `min.compaction.lag.ms=0` | the cleaner, sweeping every second |
//! | `soak-verify` | `delete` | default | unlimited | the acked records read back at the end |
//!
//! A 64 KiB segment is what makes the roll count reachable: at this suite's
//! produce rate each partition of `soak-retention` fills one every half-minute
//! or so, and the roll is driven by `segment.bytes` on the append path.
//! `--cleaner-interval` and `--log-retention-check-interval` are both set to
//! one second (the broker defaults are thirty seconds and five minutes), so a
//! three-minute local run gets around 180 opportunities of each kind rather
//! than six and zero. Those two flags are what make ten cycles of each kind
//! reachable inside the run; see [`cluster`], which sets them. The cycle counts
//! below are asserted from counters and from the segment files themselves, not
//! inferred from the clock: a soak that silently never rolled a segment, never
//! swept or never trimmed fails.
//!
//! `segment.ms` and `retention.ms`/`retention.bytes` are applied by the
//! broker-wide local-retention sweep in `krabka_broker::log_retention`, which
//! dispatches `krabka_log::Log::tick` through each partition's writer actor on
//! `log.retention.check.interval.ms`. Until that sweep existed nothing in
//! `crates/broker` called `Log::tick`, so a sealed segment was never deleted
//! and the descriptor count climbed for as long as the producer ran -- which is
//! the failure this lane found on its first run and the reason it exists.
//!
//! `soak-compacted` has no `retention.ms`, exactly as a compacted Kafka topic
//! has none: the cleaner is what bounds it. That makes it the control against
//! `soak-retention`, and the lane's remaining failure is on it rather than on
//! the retention topic -- see `tests/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.
//!
//! # What fails it
//!
//! Four series per broker -- resident set, open descriptors, `/metrics`
//! cardinality and log-directory bytes -- are sampled on a fixed interval and
//! handed to [`drift::judge`], which fails a series that exceeds its ceiling
//! or that trends upward across the second half of the run. That judgement is
//! pure logic over a list of numbers and is unit-tested in [`drift`] against
//! series whose shape is known, including the segment-roll sawtooth that a
//! first-to-last comparison would misread as a leak.
//!
//! Then: every cycle count must have been reached, the cleaner must have failed
//! zero sweeps, and every record the client saw acked on `soak-verify` must
//! still be readable.
//!
//! # Running it
//!
//! Scheduled-only. The `#[ignore]` keeps it out of `cargo test`, and
//! `//crates/broker:soak_docker_test` is tagged `docker` and excluded from the
//! container-suite selection, so no pull request runs it. The `soak` job in
//! `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is what does, nightly, with
//! `KRABKA_SOAK_SECONDS=14400`.
//!
//! A developer exercises the whole thing in a few minutes:
//!
//! ```text
//! bazel run //packaging:image_load
//! cargo test -p krabka-broker --test soak -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! which uses the default [`DEFAULT_SOAK_SECONDS`]-second run. Set
//! `KRABKA_SOAK_SECONDS` to lengthen it. The analysis and the parsing are
//! hermetic and need none of that:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p krabka-broker --test soak
//! ```
