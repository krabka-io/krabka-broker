// rustc 1.95 clippy::pedantic ICEs on this file (the same upstream bug
// in clippy's body-analysis / doc lint pass that already triggers on
// `tests/admin_handlers.rs`). Disable pedantic locally; the rest of the
// workspace still enforces the full pedantic gate.

//! Broker-side ACL integration tests. No Docker.
//!
//! T22, the first of three integration test batches, drives the
//! `CreateAcls` / `DescribeAcls` / `DeleteAcls` flow over a real
//! `SASL_PLAINTEXT` listener with the wire-typed `krabka-protocol`
//! request/response codecs. This file copies the SASL framing helpers
//! (`drive_*`, `round_trip`) inline instead of sharing them through
//! `mod common`, because Rust integration tests do not easily allow
//! sibling-module reuse across files in `tests/`.
//!
//! The suite is gated to non-Windows to match the multi-broker test
//! convention. The SASL listener starts correctly on Windows, but a uniform
//! gate avoids one-off CI matrix surprises.

// Cargo compiles this file as its own test binary, so the crate root's module
// directory is `tests/`. `#[path]` re-bases each declaration onto the sibling
// `acl_handlers/` directory, which keeps the parts out of `tests/` where every
// `.rs` file would become another test binary.
