//! The WORM archive against a real Object-Lock bucket.
//!
//! Every other WORM test proves that Krabka never issues a delete. That is a
//! statement about Krabka, and an auditor does not have to believe it. This
//! suite proves the other half: the bucket itself refuses the delete, so the
//! archive survives an operator who does issue one. `MinIO` with Object Lock in
//! compliance mode is the S3 implementation under test.
//!
//! The shared harness lives in [`jvm_acceptance`]; see it for the container
//! networking these suites depend on.
