//! The visible half of the role: the witness registers with its rack, takes a
//! replica and an ISR seat of an rf=3 partition, and is still never handed to a
//! consumer as a read replica.
//!
//! `Metadata.brokers[]` is what every admin tool resolves replica ids through,
//! so a witness missing from it would break `kafka-topics` and
//! `kafka-reassign-partitions` output. The KIP-392 check belongs with it: a
//! same-rack in-ISR replica is exactly the candidate the rack-aware selector
//! reaches for, which makes this the case where the redirect ban has to hold.
