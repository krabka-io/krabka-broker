//! The two requests every case sends, and the vocabulary it judges the answers
//! by.
//!
//! A case in this suite asks "where does this partition end, as each isolation
//! level sees it right now", and [`EndOfPartition`] answers with both readings
//! at once so the case compares one whole struct rather than two offsets in
//! sequence. [`matched_row`], [`refused_row`] and [`latest_row`] build the
//! expected values, spelling out every field of the response so an isolation
//! level that quietly changed the error code or the timestamp fails here too.
//!
//! The rest is the setup each case shares: creating the one-partition topic,
//! producing the records that precede the transaction, and waiting until the
//! log has settled so a reading taken next measures the state the case meant.
