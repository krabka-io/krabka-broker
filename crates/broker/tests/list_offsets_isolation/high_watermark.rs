/// `LATEST` under `read_uncommitted` answers the high watermark, not the log
/// end offset, so a consumer cannot seek past what the ISR acknowledged.
///
/// This is the older of the two divergences the bound closed, and the one with
/// the wider reach: it applies to every consumer on every topic, transactions
/// or not. A leader whose follower is behind holds records that are durable
/// locally and that no `Fetch` will serve. Answering `LATEST` from the log end
/// offset hands a plain `read_uncommitted` consumer a position inside that
/// unreplicated tail, where it waits for records that may yet be truncated away
/// by a leader election.
///
/// Both isolation levels are asked, because the last stable offset is capped at
/// the high watermark too -- a `read_committed` client must not read past it
/// either, and a bound that fenced only the transactional path would leave the
/// larger hole open.
