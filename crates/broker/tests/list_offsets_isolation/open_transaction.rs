//! `LATEST` while a transaction is open on the partition, and once it has
//! resolved either way.
//!
//! This is the core claim of the suite in one case: `read_committed` stops at
//! the first record the open transaction wrote, `read_uncommitted` sees the
//! whole log, and both come back to one answer after the marker lands. The
//! case runs commit and abort through the same shape because both resolutions
//! write a marker and both release the last stable offset past it -- a broker
//! that released it only on commit would leave every `read_committed` consumer
//! of the partition pinned behind a transaction that is over.
