//! The Kafka wire calls every KFC-1 case drives: `CreateTopics`, `Produce`,
//! `Fetch`, and `ListOffsets`, plus the readiness waits and the polling read
//! that turn them into the `Visible` snapshot a case asserts on.
//!
//! `ready_topic` is the one that matters most: it does not return until the
//! `delivery.mode` override has travelled all the way into the partition's own
//! `LogConfig`, which is what removes the window in which a scheduled topic
//! would still read as an immediate one.
