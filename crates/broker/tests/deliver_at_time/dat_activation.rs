//! What happens to a record between its produce and its delivery time: a read
//! taken before that time must not serve it, and a consumer already parked in a
//! long poll must be woken by the delivery advance rather than by the poll
//! expiring.
//!
//! Both cases run once on a scheduled topic and once on an immediate one, and
//! the immediate half is what shows the behaviour is the configuration.
