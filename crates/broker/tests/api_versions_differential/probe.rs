//! Deadlines for the readiness polling this suite does against a container.
//!
//! Waiting for a broker to come up means running something that talks to it and
//! asking whether it worked. The something here is a JVM tool, and the failure
//! that matters is the one where the broker never answers: `AdminClient` sits on
//! its own `default.api.timeout.ms` -- a minute in a stock client -- before the
//! tool exits non-zero, and a wedged `docker exec` need not exit at all. A retry
//! loop that blocks on each attempt therefore bounds nothing, and the "give up
//! after a minute" it looks like is really "give up after an hour, or never".
//!
//! So both halves of the loop carry a deadline: [`wait_bounded`] kills a child
//! that outruns the budget it was given, and [`retry_until`] hands each attempt
//! only the budget that is left. The whole wait then ends when the clock says
//! so, whatever the attempt inside it is doing.
