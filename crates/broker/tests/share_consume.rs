//! End-to-end integration tests for KIP-932 Slice C: share-partition consume
//! (`ShareFetch`, `api_key` 78) and acknowledge (`ShareAcknowledge`, `api_key`
//! 79), driven against an in-process Krabka broker through `krabka-client-core`.
//!
//! The typed client works because `ApiVersions` advertises `api_keys` 78/79.
//! Both `ShareFetchRequest` / `ShareAcknowledgeRequest` impl `ProtocolRequest`,
//! so `client.send(req)` returns the typed response and exercises the real wire
//! path. The client negotiates the version through `ApiVersions`. Both RPCs are
//! MIN=1 MAX=2, so the client negotiates v2.
//!
//! These tests prove the full acquire/ack loop:
//! - acquire under a lock and read the verbatim record bytes;
//! - Accept advances the SPSO, and the advance survives a broker restart, which
//!   shows the broker persisted it to the share coordinator;
//! - Release re-delivers with an incremented `delivery_count`;
//! - Reject archives and advances the SPSO past the poison record;
//! - the background lock-timeout sweep re-delivers an unacknowledged lock that
//!   expires;
//! - the broker archives a record that exhausts `max_delivery_attempts` (poison
//!   pill);
//! - the share-session epoch state machine rejects stale / unknown epochs.
//!
//! The binary root carries only the error-code and ack-type constants the
//! whole suite shares, plus the module tree below. `harness` starts the broker
//! and prepares the topic, the group, and the share state; `share_rpc` drives
//! the two RPCs; and each remaining child covers one consume behaviour --
//! acknowledgement outcomes, the record bytes a fetch returns, the
//! acquisition-lock lifetime, the share-session state machine, and
//! `read_committed` isolation.
