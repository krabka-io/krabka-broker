/// `kafka-leader-election --election-type unclean` fails without an approved
/// proposal, and stops failing once two people approve one.
///
/// This is the case that proves an approval is a standing authorization rather
/// than a request field. `kafka-leader-election` sends the stock `ElectLeaders`
/// that KIP-460 defines, with nowhere to put a proposal id, and the operator
/// gets the approval out of band through the krabka-private APIs. The tool is
/// byte-for-byte the same on both runs; only the metadata image differs.
///
/// The success run exits zero rather than electing anything. The partition is
/// healthy on a single node, so an unclean election answers
/// `ELECTION_NOT_NEEDED` (84), which `LeaderElectionCommand` counts as a no-op
/// and not a failure. That is the honest signal available here: the request
/// got past the two-person rule, which is the whole of what the approval
/// changed. The assertions say exactly that and no more.
