/// `kafka-configs` reads the freeze and cannot write it.

/// KFC-9 synthesises a read-only `write.freeze` topic config so that an
/// operator holding only the JVM tools can see a freeze at all: they cannot
/// call `DescribeTopicFreezes`, and the value is the one place the scope that
/// froze the topic is legible to them. The other half of the rule is that the
/// key is never writable, because a key that could be set through
/// `AlterConfigs` would put the freeze registry behind an ordinary topic-config
/// ACL and let a snapshot restore resurrect a stale freeze.
///
/// The three alter rows differ only in the operation the same tool sends: set
/// a freeze, clear one, and delete the key. All three are refused with one
/// wording, and the `--delete-config` row reaches the broker at all only
/// because the frozen topic reports the key as a dynamic config, which is what
/// `kafka-configs` checks before it sends a delete.
///
/// The describe after the loop is the proof that the refusals refused. Three
/// rejected alters that had quietly changed the registry would pass every
/// assertion above.
