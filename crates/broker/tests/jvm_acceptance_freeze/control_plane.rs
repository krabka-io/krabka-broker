//! The setup a case performs through krabka's own APIs before any JVM tool
//! runs: the topics, the freezes, and the break-glass proposal two operators
//! approve.
//!
//! Every call here travels a krabka-private API that a JVM tool cannot reach,
//! so it is fixture rather than finding: a setup step that fails stops the case
//! with `assert!`. The approval count is the one exception, because the
//! two-person rule is what the case is about, and it is checked the way the
//! suite checks everything else.
