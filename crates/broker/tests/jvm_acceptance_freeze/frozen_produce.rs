/// must fail the batch, must not retry, and must surface the broker's own
/// sentence -- which names the scope that matched, because a topic can be
/// frozen by its own name or by a prefix over a thousand topics and the thaw
/// is a different command in each case.
///
/// The three rows differ only in the topic the same tool writes to. The
/// prefixed row matters on its own: its topic appears in no registry entry by
/// name, so it exercises the prefix index rather than the literal one. The
/// control row is what keeps the other two honest.
