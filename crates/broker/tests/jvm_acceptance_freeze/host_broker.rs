//! [`start_jvm_broker`] boots one broker on the host and hands back both
//! addresses it answers on: loopback, which the host-side control plane dials,
//! and `host.docker.internal`, which the JVM tools inside containers bootstrap
//! against. [`sasl_listener`] and [`gate_on`] are the adjustments the
//! break-glass cases make and the freeze cases do not, and [`sasl_props`] is
//! the client-side half of the first of them.
