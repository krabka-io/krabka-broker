//! The Kafka 4.x transactional client against a `transaction.version=2`
//! broker, and the `kafka-transactions` admin tool against the transaction it
//! leaves open.
//!
//! [`transactional_eos`](super::transactional_eos) runs the same JVM producer
//! source inside `cp-kafka:7.5.0`, whose Kafka 3.5 client predates KIP-890: it
//! registers every partition with `AddPartitionsToTxn` and never sees an epoch
//! in an `EndTxn` response. This case runs the *compiled* class under Kafka
//! 4.3.1's client jars instead, where the `TransactionManager` finalizes
//! `transaction.version=2` from `ApiVersions` and therefore:
//!
//! - sends no `AddPartitionsToTxn` at all -- Produce v12 carries the partition
//!   into the transaction, which is asserted from the broker's own
//!   `krabka_broker_api_requests_total{api_key="AddPartitionsToTxn"}` series
//!   rather than from a client-side debug trace; and
//! - takes the bumped `producer_epoch` out of the `EndTxn` v5 response, so the
//!   second transaction is written at a strictly higher epoch than the first.
//!
//! The class is compiled in [`KAFKA_IMAGE_TXN`], which is the only pinned
//! image with a `javac`, and run in [`KAFKA_IMAGE_ELR`], which is JRE-only.
//! `--release 11` is what that JDK can target -- `cp-kafka:7.5.0` ships Zulu
//! `OpenJDK` 11 -- and a class file at that level runs unchanged on the JRE 21
//! in the 4.3.1 image. The helper touches only `KafkaProducer`,
//! `ProducerRecord` and `ProducerConfig` constants, so compiling against the
//! 3.5 jars and running against the 4.3.1 ones resolves identically; what
//! decides the protocol is the 4.3.1 client that runs it.
//!
//! The second half drives `kafka-transactions.sh` (KIP-664:
//! `ListTransactions`, `DescribeTransactions`, `DescribeProducers` and the
//! `WriteTxnMarkers` behind `abort`) against a transaction that is deliberately
//! left open, and compares every rendered column with the answer the same
//! broker gives an in-process `krabka-client-core` admin client. The open
//! transaction is held by an in-process producer rather than by the JVM helper,
//! because the helper commits and aborts and then exits: nothing in it can be
//! made to hold a transaction open while a container runs beside it.
