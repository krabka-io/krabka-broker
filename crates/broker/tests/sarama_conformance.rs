//! `kaf` -- a Go CLI on IBM/sarama -- against krabka.
//!
//! Every other non-JVM client this tree drives is librdkafka, so one decoder
//! stands behind every non-JVM row of the evidence set. sarama is an
//! independent reimplementation of the protocol: its own request-version
//! floors, its own header and tagged-field handling, its own tolerance for
//! absent optional fields. A response only librdkafka and the JVM client
//! accept would pass every other suite here and fail this one.
//!
//! ## What the client is pinned to
//!
//! The image is built in this repository from an apko lock
//! (`//bazel/images:kaf_sarama_tar`), and that lock is what pins the binary.
//! `kaf --version` is no help: the release build stamps the version through
//! goreleaser, and the Wolfi package does not, so the binary reports
//! `latest (HEAD)` whatever it is. There is therefore no version banner to
//! assert on, and nothing below asserts on one -- what the suite pins is
//! behaviour.
//!
//! ## Which RPC each command issues
//!
//! sarama at the version this client builds against implements neither
//! `DescribeCluster` (api key 60) nor `DescribeTopicPartitions` (api key 75):
//! `request.go` lists both as unimplemented, and `ClusterAdmin::DescribeCluster`
//! and `ClusterAdmin::DescribeTopics` are both `Metadata` round-trips. So
//! `kaf nodes` and `kaf topic describe` do *not* exercise those two APIs, and
//! this suite does not claim they do. What it establishes instead is that the
//! answers agree: krabka's own `DescribeCluster` and `DescribeTopicPartitions`
//! responses are read on the host and used to *build* the rows `kaf` must
//! print from `Metadata`. A broker whose newer cluster and topic APIs drifted
//! from what it says in `Metadata` fails here.
//!
//! ## The versions this suite actually pins, and why they are fixed
//!
//! `kaf`'s `getConfig` sets `saramaConfig.Version = sarama.V1_1_0_0` and only a
//! config file's `cluster.Version` raises it (`cmd/kaf/kaf.go:24-35`). Nothing
//! here writes a config file, so 1.1 is what runs -- and at 1.1 **sarama sends
//! no `ApiVersions` request at all**:
//!
//! ```text
//! // broker.go:177
//! usingApiVersionsRequests := conf.Version.IsAtLeast(V2_4_0_0) && conf.ApiVersionsRequest
//! ```
//!
//! `ApiVersionsRequest` defaults to true (`config.go:560`), but the `V2_4_0_0`
//! conjunct is false, so the KIP-511 exchange never happens. Every request
//! version below is chosen from `conf.Version` alone and sent at krabka
//! sight-unseen, which makes this the one suite here where a client's floors
//! are not negotiated:
//!
//! | RPC | version | where sarama picks it |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `FindCoordinator` | 1 | `client.go:1213-1216` (2 needs `V2_0_0_0`) |
//! | `JoinGroup` | 2 | `consumer_group.go:451-461` (3 needs `V2_0_0_0`) |
//! | `SyncGroup` | 1 | `consumer_group.go:521-524` (2 needs `V2_0_0_0`) |
//! | `OffsetCommit` | 3 | `offset_manager.go:286-304` (4 needs `V2_1_0_0`) |
//!
//! A previous revision of this doc claimed the versions were "negotiated by an
//! `ApiVersions` exchange". That was wrong, and the line above is what replaces
//! it.
//!
//! ## What has been ruled out for the group path, and how
//!
//! CI has failed this suite on the group phase. These were checked by reading
//! `birdayz/kaf` at `v0.2.14` and `IBM/sarama` at `v1.43.2`, the revisions the
//! image's `go.mod` pins:
//!
//! * **`kaf` does reach `sarama.NewConsumerGroupFromClient`.** `consumeCmd.Run`
//!   has exactly one branch on the way there -- `if groupFlag != ""` at
//!   `consume.go:142` -- and `--group` is passed. Nothing between flag parsing
//!   and that branch can `errorExit`: `PreRun` is a no-op while `--proto-type`
//!   is unset, `--offset oldest` takes the `case "oldest"` arm rather than the
//!   `strconv.ParseInt` arm that can exit (`consume.go:119-132`), and the
//!   header-filter loop is skipped with no `--header`.
//! * **No config file and no `KAFKA_*` env is needed.** `onInit` synthesises
//!   `currentCluster` when `cfg.ActiveCluster()` is nil and then overwrites its
//!   brokers from the flag (`kaf.go:194-214`), so `currentCluster` is never nil
//!   with `--brokers` and no config. The same code already served `kaf topics`
//!   and `kaf produce` earlier in this test.
//! * **`--offset oldest` is not lost to ordering.** It is set on `cfg` *after*
//!   `getClientFromConfig(cfg)` has already built the client, but `getConfig`
//!   returns a `*sarama.Config` and `sarama.NewClient` keeps that pointer
//!   (`kaf.go:238-244`), so `cfg.Consumer.Offsets.Initial = OffsetOldest` at
//!   `consume.go:122` still reaches the session.
//! * **A group path that cannot proceed exits; it does not hang.** Every wait
//!   sarama takes there is bounded: `findCoordinator` retries
//!   `Metadata.Retry.Max` = 3 at 250 ms (`config.go:520-521`) with a 2 s sleep
//!   per attempt when the answer is `COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE`
//!   (`client.go:1240-1247`); `newSession` retries
//!   `Consumer.Group.Rebalance.Retry.Max` = 4 at 2 s (`config.go:554-555`); and
//!   a `JoinGroup` or `SyncGroup` that is never answered hits
//!   `Net.ReadTimeout` = 30 s (`broker.go:937`, `config.go:515`) and is
//!   returned rather than retried (`consumer_group.go:294-300`). The ceiling is
//!   therefore about `5 * (2 + 9) + 30` seconds, and past it `Consume` returns
//!   an error that `withConsumerGroup` turns into `errorExit`
//!   (`consume.go:181-184`), which [`GroupConsumer::exited`] observes.
//!
//! What is *not* ruled out is which side of `JoinGroup`/`SyncGroup` fails, and
//! that is the point of the two waits below rather than one: the phase banners
//! and sarama's own `--verbose` log are streamed as they happen, so the answer
//! is in the log from the first second rather than only in an assertion message
//! at the very end. The last CI failure was diagnosed by arithmetic on Bazel's
//! wall clock because a sibling suite in the same shard had pushed this one's
//! output past GitHub's log-API truncation point; streaming is what stops that
//! from happening again, since truncation drops the tail.
