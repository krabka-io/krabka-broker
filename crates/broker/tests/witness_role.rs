//! End-to-end coverage for the data-bearing witness role (KFC-2).
//!
//! A witness replicates partition data and votes in `KRaft`, so it is an ISR
//! member and counts toward `min.insync.replicas`. It serves no client traffic
//! and it never leads a partition. Those two halves are what this suite pins
//! down on a live three-site cluster:
//!
//! * **Visible.** The witness registers like any other broker, rack and all.
//!   `kafka-topics` and `kafka-reassign-partitions` render replica ids through
//!   `Metadata.brokers[]`, so a witness that vanished from that list would turn
//!   every admin tool's replica column into an unresolved id.
//! * **In the replica set and in the ISR.** That membership is the whole point
//!   of the role: it is what keeps `acks=all` writable after a site loss.
//! * **Closed to clients.** A `Produce` or a consumer `Fetch` that reaches a
//!   witness gets `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER`, the code that makes a Kafka client
//!   refresh its metadata and go elsewhere. A *follower* fetch still works,
//!   which is why the witness holds the data at all.
//! * **Never a read replica.** A KIP-392 consumer whose `client.rack` names the
//!   witness site is not redirected there, even though the witness is an
//!   in-ISR same-rack replica and therefore the most attractive candidate the
//!   rack-aware selector sees.
//! * **Read-only in the config surface.** `broker.witness` is controller-
//!   managed: `DescribeConfigs` reports it read-only and
//!   `IncrementalAlterConfigs` rejects it with `INVALID_CONFIG`.
//!
//! Every wait here is bounded. The shared `support` awaiters carry their own
//! 30s bound; the loops in this file wrap theirs in `tokio::time::timeout`, so
//! a stuck cluster reports in seconds instead of hitting CI's 600s kill, which
//! is reported as TIMEOUT with no cause.
