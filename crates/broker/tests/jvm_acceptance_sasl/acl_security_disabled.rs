//! `kafka-acls --list` against a broker that has no authorizer.
//!
//! Kafka answers `DescribeAcls`, `CreateAcls` and `DeleteAcls` with
//! `SECURITY_DISABLED` (54) and "No Authorizer is configured." whenever
//! `authorizer.class.name` is unset, and krabka's `allow_all` authorizer -- the
//! default, and not a decision point -- is that same state. An empty listing
//! would be the dangerous answer here: it tells an operator that the cluster
//! has no ACLs, when the truth is that it would never consult one.
//!
//! What the tool prints for that refusal is Kafka's business, so this case
//! states none of it. It runs the same `apache/kafka:4.3.1` `kafka-acls`
//! against a stock broker of that release with no authorizer configured and
//! against krabka with its default one, and holds the two renderings of the
//! error against each other. The one claim it makes on its own is the part
//! that cannot be in doubt: the refusal both sides print names
//! `SecurityDisabledException` and carries Kafka's message, so a pair of
//! brokers that both answered an empty listing cannot pass.
//!
//! Both brokers are plaintext and neither has a principal to authenticate, so
//! unlike the rest of this suite the invocation needs no client configuration.
