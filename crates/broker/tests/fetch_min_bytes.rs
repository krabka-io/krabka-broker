//! `fetch.min.bytes` is a floor, at the wire.
//!
//! A Fetch whose `min_bytes` is above everything the log holds must be held
//! until `max_wait_ms` expires and must then answer with what is there. A
//! broker that treats the field as a hint answers on the first append instead,
//! which is a partial response per round trip for every consumer that raised
//! the floor -- Streams and Connect do.
//!
//! The same exchange runs against a pinned Apache Kafka broker in
//! `fetch_min_bytes_jvm`, which is where the claim that this is Kafka's
//! behavior and not just krabka's is checked. That half needs Docker and is
//! `#[ignore]`d; this one is hermetic.
//!
//! Cargo compiles this file as its own test binary, so the shared exchange
//! carries an explicit `#[path]` onto the sibling `fetch_min_bytes/`
//! directory; `support` is a `tests/<name>/mod.rs` helper, which the crate-root
//! rule already resolves.
