/// Two-broker `SASL_SSL` cluster with `controller_listener_protocol =

/// client, and asserts that both brokers replicate the records. It exercises
/// the full production-shape stack: TLS-terminated controller raft RPC,
/// TLS-terminated data-plane SASL, and rf=2 follower replication. The
/// earlier simplified inter-broker test only proved metadata convergence.
///
/// Networking: like the `SASL_PLAINTEXT` inter-broker test, this test
/// advertises `host.docker.internal:<port>` so the JVM containers can reach
/// the brokers. Under WSL2 the broker→broker `InterBrokerClient` hop can
/// fail, because `host.docker.internal` resolves to the Windows host IP and
/// not to the WSL VM where the peers live. The CI runner's `/etc/hosts`
/// setup makes that hop work end-to-end. On WSL the test can time out at
/// the rf=2 offset check even when `SASL_SSL` itself is correctly wired.
