//! The faults themselves, and the witness that says each one really landed.
//!
//! There are three faults, and they are injected in this order.
//!
//! 1. **The object store is unavailable.** `RemoteStorageBackend::Local`
//!    writes under `<dir>/diskless-wal/<broker>/<uuid>.ckwl`, so a plain file
//!    where that directory belongs makes every PUT fail at the filesystem.
//!    The witness is the flusher's own failure counter, sampled before and
//!    after, not the presence of the file.
//! 2. **The acking broker is lost, canonical log and all.** It is killed
//!    without a controlled shutdown, then its `<topic>-<partition>` directory
//!    is erased. The file count is taken before the erase, so an empty
//!    directory cannot pass for a node-loss injection.
//! 3. **The controller authority moves.** The dead broker led the controller
//!    as well, so the survivors have to elect a new one before the partition
//!    can be reassigned. The witness is that the two leaders differ.
//!
//! [`assert_complete_witness`] is the guard on all of it: every field has to
//! be filled in, and the two leader pairs have to name different nodes. A
//! schedule that silently skipped a fault fails there rather than passing.
