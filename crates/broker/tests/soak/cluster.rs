//! A three-broker krabka cluster, each broker a real container process.
//!
//! The fixture is [`process_kill_durability`]'s single-node one widened to a
//! quorum: the same packaging image, the same host-tempdir bind mount at
//! `/var/lib/krabka`, the same `--user` matched to the host directory's owner
//! so the container can write it, and the same `krabka-format` run through
//! `--entrypoint` before the broker starts.
//!
//! Three things are new, and all three come from there being peers.
//!
//! **Addressing.** A container's `127.0.0.1` is its own, so a broker cannot
//! advertise loopback to the other two. Every node publishes its client and
//! controller ports on the host and advertises `host.docker.internal:<port>`
//! for both, which the containers resolve through
//! `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` and the host resolves through
//! the `/etc/hosts` line CI's container jobs already add. One name that both
//! sides can reach, which is what the JVM suites in this crate do for the
//! reverse direction.
//!
//! **The quorum.** `--standalone` writes a one-voter `VotersRecord`. Here each
//! node is formatted with the same `--cluster-id` and the same
//! `--initial-controllers` list naming all three by id, controller endpoint and
//! directory id, so the three logs agree on the voter set before any of them
//! boots.
//!
//! **Sampling.** `docker inspect` gives each container's host-side pid, and
//! because the process runs as the host user that owns its data directory,
//! `/proc/<pid>/status` and `/proc/<pid>/fd` are readable from the test without
//! a shell inside the image -- which the apko base does not carry.
//!
//! [`process_kill_durability`]: ../process_kill_durability.rs
