//! Whether a series of resource samples is level, or is climbing.
//!
//! This is the judgement the soak lane exists to make, so it is a pure function
//! over a list of numbers rather than something the sampling loop decides
//! inline. A soak that crashes is easy to read; a soak that finishes green
//! while its resident set grew by a third is the one that costs an operator a
//! weekend, and the only way to be sure this file catches that is to feed it
//! series whose shape is known.
//!
//! Two rules, applied to every series:
//!
//! 1. **A ceiling.** No sample may exceed a stated bound. This is the absolute
//!    statement -- "a krabka broker under this load stays under 1.5 GiB" -- and
//!    the one an operator can size a machine from.
//! 2. **A trend over the second half.** The first half of a soak is warm-up:
//!    caches fill, the fetch-session table reaches its steady size, the first
//!    segments roll. What has to be flat is what happens *after* that, so the
//!    trend is fitted over the samples from the run's midpoint onwards and
//!    nothing earlier.
//!
//! The trend is a least-squares slope, not a first-to-last difference, because
//! the series this judges are sawtooths by construction: a log directory under
//! retention grows until the cleaner deletes a segment and then drops, over and
//! over. A first-to-last comparison of such a series says whatever the phase of
//! the last sample happens to be. A slope over a whole number of teeth is zero,
//! and over a partial one is small -- which is why the tolerance is a fraction
//! of the series' own mean rather than an absolute number of bytes, and why
//! [`a_segment_roll_sawtooth_is_level`] is one of the tests below.
//!
//! [`a_segment_roll_sawtooth_is_level`]: tests::a_segment_roll_sawtooth_is_level
