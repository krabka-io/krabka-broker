//! Reading a resource level off a running broker, and off its log directory.
//!
//! Nothing in this workspace measured a resource level before this suite: a
//! search for `getrusage`, `VmRSS` or `/proc/self/fd` across `crates/` found
//! nothing, and `docs/operations/capacity.md` tells the operator to size file
//! descriptors as "one per client connection plus the segment files of every
//! replica" while `krabka_broker_active_connections` counts only the first
//! half. These are the four numbers that make that sizing checkable:
//!
//! | sample | where it comes from | what a rise would mean |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | resident set | `/proc/<pid>/status` `VmRSS` | a leak: producer-id state, fetch sessions, the diskless hot tail |
//! | open descriptors | entries in `/proc/<pid>/fd` | segment handles or connections not being closed |
//! | `/metrics` series | sample lines in the scraped body | an unbounded metric family -- a per-partition or per-client label set that never drops a member |
//! | log-directory bytes | the host side of the bind mount | retention not keeping up with the producer |
//!
//! The pid comes from `docker inspect` and the container runs as the host user
//! that owns its data directory, so both `/proc` reads work from the test
//! process without a shell inside the image. The parsing is separated from the
//! IO here because the parsing is what can be wrong quietly: a `VmRSS` line
//! read in the wrong unit, or a `/metrics` count that included the `# HELP`
//! lines, would move every number this lane judges.
