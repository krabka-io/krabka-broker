//! A bounded Jepsen-style fault schedule over a live diskless WAL quorum.
//!
//! The one case below boots three real brokers, creates an RF=1 diskless
//! topic, pins its sole classic replica onto the broker that also leads the
//! controller, and then takes that broker away. Every acknowledged record must
//! still read back afterwards, from a broker that never held a classic replica
//! of the partition.
//!
//! ## What the schedule proves
//!
//! The faults overlap on purpose, because each one alone has an escape. The
//! object store is blocked before the first produce, so a flush cannot rescue
//! the tail. The acking broker is killed and its canonical log is erased, so a
//! local fsync cannot serve the readback. The controller leader goes with it,
//! so the promotion is a real authority handoff rather than a metadata edit on
//! a live leader. What remains is the WAL quorum on the two survivors, and the
//! readback can only come from there.
//!
//! Two independent readers check the same offsets: a direct Rust partition
//! fetch and the JVM `kafka-console-consumer` in a container. The second one
//! is a byte differential against a client this project does not write.
//!
//! Every fault carries a discriminating witness, so a no-op fails. A blocked
//! PUT is counted on the flusher's own failure metric before and after the
//! crash, the erased log is counted on disk before it is erased, and the two
//! leader handoffs are asserted to name different nodes.
//!
//! ## Why the cluster runs two listeners
//!
//! A diskless quorum in this tree needs an **authenticated** inter-broker
//! listener. A WAL follower's Fetch is authorized against the caller's
//! principal: the leader resolves `broker-<id>` to a node id and serves the
//! shard only to a voter that is who it claims to be. That convention applies
//! only to connections on the inter-broker listener, so an anonymous plaintext
//! cluster never forms a quorum at all.
//!
//! The JVM console consumer runs in a container and has to reach the brokers
//! from there, which means the client-facing endpoint must advertise
//! `host.docker.internal`. Putting SASL on that same endpoint would make the
//! container hold credentials for a test whose subject is durability, not
//! authentication.
//!
//! So each broker binds two data-plane listeners: a `PLAINTEXT` one on all
//! interfaces that advertises `host.docker.internal` and carries every client
//! in the suite, and a `SASL_PLAINTEXT` one on loopback that
//! `inter_broker_listener_name` selects and that carries the raft, replication
//! and WAL follower traffic. `BrokerConfig.listeners` is a list, so this costs
//! one more `ListenerSpec` per broker.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! The binary root carries the module tree, the constants every part shares
//! and the one case. [`cluster`] boots the three brokers and drives their
//! metadata, [`history`] produces the ledger and checks it for
//! linearizability, [`faults`] injects each fault and holds the witness, and
//! [`readback`] reads the acknowledged offsets back with both clients.
