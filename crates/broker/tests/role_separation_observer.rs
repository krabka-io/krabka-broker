//! Component B integration test, with a controller-only node and broker-only
//! observers.
//!
//! An observer replicates metadata through fetch, not through openraft. A
//! `CreateTopics` forwarded through the observer reaches the controller and
//! comes back to the observer's image. The observer never joins the voter
//! set.
//!
//! The second test covers the other half of role separation: the brokers stay
//! *unfenced*. A broker's `BrokerHeartbeat` goes to the controller leader's
//! CONTROLLER listener, which is the only endpoint a controller-only node
//! publishes for itself, and the controller's liveness registry fences every
//! registered broker it does not hear from within `heartbeat_timeout`. It also
//! covers what the metadata surface then advertises: `controller_id` has to
//! name a broker the caller can resolve out of the same response, which the
//! controller-only node's own id never is. The controller-only node itself
//! opens no client listener, so a client never reaches it at all.
