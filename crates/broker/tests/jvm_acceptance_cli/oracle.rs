//! One `apache/kafka:4.3.1` broker in a container, and the same admin tool run
//! against it and against krabka.
//!
//! This is the harness `tests/unavailable_partitions_jvm.rs` writes inline,
//! lifted so more than one suite can use it. The shape it establishes is the
//! whole point of the differential: the *same* release's tool, from the *same*
//! image, is aimed first at a stock broker and then at krabka, and the two
//! answers are parsed and compared. A hand-written expectation can be wrong
//! about Kafka. An oracle cannot: if the rule a case states is wrong, the
//! oracle half fails first and krabka is never blamed for it.
//!
//! # Why the two sides are addressed differently
//!
//! The oracle broker listens inside its own container, so its tools run there
//! too, through `docker exec`, and it publishes no port -- two suites running
//! at once cannot collide. krabka runs on the host, so its tools run in a
//! throwaway `docker run --rm` container that reaches back through
//! `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`. [`crate::jvm_acceptance`]
//! documents that arrangement and why `--network host` is not used.
//!
//! [`Side`] is what makes a case blind to that difference: it takes a tool
//! name, its arguments and the files the tool needs, and answers with what the
//! tool printed. A case therefore states each invocation once.
//!
//! # Layout note
//!
//! The module physically lives beside the `jvm_acceptance_cli` parts and is
//! re-based into `jvm_acceptance_sasl` and `jvm_acceptance_reassign` with
//! `#[path]`, so the three binaries share one copy rather than three that can
//! drift.

// Three binaries link this module and each uses only the part of it its own
// cases need, the same arrangement as `tests/jvm_acceptance/mod.rs`.
