//! The two mixed-vintage paths, in which one side of the round trip is a Kafka
//! 0.10.1 tool and the other is a Kafka 2.6 tool.

//! Together they pin the two conversions separately: a modern consumer proves
//! the up-converted v2 `RecordBatch` on disk is well formed, and a 0.10.1
//! consumer proves the down-converted v0/v1 `MessageSet` is.
