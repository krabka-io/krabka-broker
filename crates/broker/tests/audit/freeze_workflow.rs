//! The KFC-9 freeze-and-thaw workflow, and the cluster that hosts it.
//!
//! One whole incident goes over the wire here: alice freezes `orders` under
//! her own operator key, opens a break-glass proposal for the thaw, bob and
//! carol approve it, and alice thaws. A second proposal is then withdrawn
//! rather than spent, because a withdrawal is the one path that reaches the
//! `consumed` phase with no Kafka transition behind it. The cases in
//! [`crate::freeze_evidence`] and [`crate::freeze_metrics`] read that run back,
//! off the audit topic and off the metric families.
//!
//! # Why this runs over SASL
//!
//! A two-person rule needs two people. A plaintext listener authenticates
//! every connection as one name, so a proposer over such a listener is also
//! the only available approver and the broker refuses them by design. This
//! cluster speaks `SASL_PLAINTEXT` so that alice, bob and carol are three real
//! principals and no broker-side shortcut stands in for a second person.
