//! The audit log as evidence in its own right.
//!
//! KFC-9's load-bearing claim is that the audit log *alone* answers who did
//! what. An auditor holding this topic and the operator public keys has to be
//! able to say who froze a topic, who approved the thaw, and which approval
//! authorized which transition — with no metadata image to read and no broker
//! to take anybody's word for. The unit tests cannot reach that claim: they
//! observe the event on its way into the log rather than on its way back out
//! of it.
//!
//! Each case here drives the whole workflow in [`crate::freeze_workflow`] over
//! the wire and then reads the answer back off `__krabka_audit`.
