//! JVM differential / interop test for KIP-1071 streams groups (the Streams
//! Rebalance Protocol).
//!
//! The test drives the REAL Apache Kafka 4.1.0 `kafka-streams-groups.sh` admin
//! tool, a `KafkaStreamsGroupsCommand` that wraps the JVM `AdminClient`. The
//! tool runs inside an `mirror.gcr.io/apache/kafka:4.1.0` container against an
//! in-process Krabka broker on the host. The container has a JRE-only Kafka
//! image with no `javac` or `jshell`, so we cannot compile a custom
//! `KafkaStreams` app. Instead we use the native `krabka-client-core` client to
//! make a streams group EXIST on Krabka. The client finalizes
//! `streams.version=1`, creates a source topic, and drives a
//! `StreamsGroupHeartbeat` so the group has a live member with an assignment.
//! We then point the bundled JVM admin tool at Krabka and prove it round-trips
//! the streams-group admin wire path.
//!
//! The compiled topology this suite cannot run lives in
//! `tests/jvm_streams_app.rs`: it builds a real `KafkaStreams` app in the
//! `cp-kafka:7.5.0` image, which does ship `javac`, and runs it against Krabka
//! on both the classic protocol and `group.protocol=streams`. This suite stays
//! the one that reads the KIP-1071 ADMIN wire path off a real
//! `AdminClient`'s DEBUG log.
//!
//! The real `apache-kafka-java` 4.1.0 `AdminClient` drives this flow, read
//! empirically from its DEBUG wire log:
//!
//! - `ApiVersions` negotiation (key 18): Krabka advertises api keys 88/89 and
//!   the finalized `streams.version` feature,
//! - `Metadata` (key 13) to discover the broker set,
//! - `ListGroups` (key 16, v5) with `typesFilter=[Streams]`, which is the
//!   KIP-1071 `ListGroupsOptions.forStreamsGroups()` filter, and Krabka returns
//!   the live streams group,
//! - `FindCoordinator` (key 10) for the group,
//! - `StreamsGroupDescribe` (key 89): Krabka returns the full `DescribedGroup`,
//!   which the JVM `DescribeStreamsGroupsHandler` accepts. That group holds the
//!   group state and epochs, the resolved topology, and the member with its
//!   active task assignment.
//!
//! The test is gated `#[ignore = "requires Docker"]`. Run it with `--ignored`.
//!
//! Networking mirrors `jvm_share_groups.rs`: the broker binds `0.0.0.0:9092`
//! and advertises `host.docker.internal:9092`. The container reaches it with
//! `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`.
