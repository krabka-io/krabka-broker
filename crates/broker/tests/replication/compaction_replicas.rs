//! Log compaction on every replica of a partition.
//!
//! Kafka's cleaner keeps the batch that holds the last sequence of each active
//! producer, as an empty batch when compaction removes all of its records
//! (`Cleaner.cleanInto`, `isBatchLastRecordOfProducer`). It reads the active
//! producers from the producer state of the log
//! (`UnifiedLog.lastRecordsOfActiveProducers`), which a follower updates for
//! each batch that it replicates. A follower that compacts its log therefore
//! keeps the same batches as its leader.
//!
//! The produce path of this broker keeps a second copy of the producer state,
//! and a follower does not add its replicated data batches to that copy. A
//! cleaner that read that copy removed the last batch of an idempotent
//! producer on each follower. A new leader then had no batch that held the
//! sequence of the producer.
