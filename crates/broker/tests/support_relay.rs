//! Coverage for the `support::relay` fault injector.
//!
//! `tests/support/` is helper code compiled into *every* integration-test
//! binary in this crate, so it cannot carry `#[test]` functions of its own —
//! they would run once per binary. The relay's own tests therefore live here, in
//! a dedicated suite whose upstream is a plain echo server rather than a broker:
//! what is under test is the forwarding and the cut, not anything Kafka.
//!
//! Every wait is bounded with `tokio::time::timeout`. A relay bug is usually a
//! read that never completes, and an unbounded wait would turn that into CI's
//! 600s kill, reported as TIMEOUT with no cause; a bounded one fails in seconds
//! and says which step hung.
