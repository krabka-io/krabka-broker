//! JVM cross-validation: a real JVM consumer is unaffected by barrier markers.
//!
//! This suite carries the load-bearing compatibility claim of the barrier
//! feature. A barrier marker is a Kafka control record, and the whole design
//! rests on the promise that an ordinary consumer skips one without noticing.
//! Every other test in this repository checks that promise against krabka's
//! own client, which krabka also wrote. This one checks it against Apache
//! Kafka's.
//!
//! The broker runs on the host and advertises `host.docker.internal`, and the
//! JVM tools run in a container. [`jvm_acceptance`] documents that networking.
//!
//! What the suite proves, per partition:
//!
//! 1. The JVM consumer reads exactly the produced records, in produce order,
//!    and no marker reaches it as a record.
//! 2. The log end offset that the JVM tooling reports is larger than the record
//!    count, by exactly the number of markers injected into that partition. The
//!    markers hold real offsets, and the consumer stepped over them.
//! 3. Neither claim changes under `read_committed`. A barrier marker carries no
//!    producer id, so the isolation level has nothing to say about it.
//!
//! Point 2 is the one that distinguishes "the consumer skipped the markers"
//! from "the broker never wrote them". Without it a broker that dropped every
//! marker would pass.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p crabka-broker --test jvm_barrier_markers -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
