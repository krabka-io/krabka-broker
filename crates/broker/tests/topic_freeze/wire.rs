//! The request shapes every case sends, and the vocabulary it judges a produce by.
//!
//! A freeze case asks "produce once, then tell me what happened", and
//! [`ProduceOutcome`] answers in the four terms that together decide the
//! feature: the error code, the `error_message` the producer's on-call reads,
//! the `base_offset` the row reports, and the partition's log end offset
//! afterwards. [`accepted`] and [`refused`] build the two expected values, so
//! a case compares one whole struct instead of four fields that could each
//! pass while the outcome is wrong.
