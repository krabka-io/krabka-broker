//! The two RPCs that carry the freeze registry, and the waits a case needs
//! before it reads the result of one.
//!
//! `SetTopicFreeze` reports a refusal in its own `error_code` and never as a
//! transport failure, so [`set_freeze`] hands the whole response back and lets
//! the case read one shape whatever the outcome.
//! [`wait_for_registry_len`] polls `DescribeTopicFreezes` rather than sleeping:
//! that handler and the produce gate both read the controller's current image,
//! so a registry that answers over the wire is a produce path that answers too.
