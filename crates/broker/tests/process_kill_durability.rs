//! What an `acks=all` ack is worth when the process holding the log is killed.
//!
//! Every other durability suite in this repository stops a broker by calling
//! [`krabka_broker::BrokerHandle::shutdown`], which cancels the replicator
//! supervisor, drains the disk scanner and awaits every listener task before
//! anything drops. That is a graceful drain, and a graceful drain is not the
//! question an operator asks. The question is whether a record the client was
//! *told* was durable is still there after the process that told it so went
//! away without warning.
//!
//! So this suite runs the broker as a real process out of `//packaging`'s
//! image -- the same binary, base and entrypoint that ship -- and kills it with
//! `SIGKILL`, mid-produce, over and over.
//!
//! # The fsync policy the guarantee is stated under
//!
//! [`krabka_log::LogConfig::flush_on_append`] defaults to `false` and no broker
//! path turns it on: the classic partition log is written with `write(2)` and
//! is *not* fsynced per append.
//! [`flush_on_append_stays_off_by_default`] pins that, because it is the
//! premise of everything below. Under it the guarantee this suite proves is:
//!
//! > A single-broker cluster with `acks=all` and `min.insync.replicas=1`
//! > keeps every record the client saw acked across a `SIGKILL` of the broker
//! > process, and comes back with its log ending on a valid batch boundary.
//!
//! That is a statement about *process* loss, not machine loss. `SIGKILL` ends
//! the process; it does not evict the page cache, so bytes the broker had
//! already handed the kernel are still on their way to the disk and the file
//! the next boot opens contains them. Machine loss is the strictly harder case
//! and, without a per-append fsync, is not covered here -- see the tail-tearing
//! note below for how far this suite goes towards it.
//!
//! One broker, deliberately: a follower that already holds the record would
//! make the ack survivable for a reason that has nothing to do with fsync.
//! With `replication.factor=1` the leader is the only copy, so the answer is
//! about the write path alone.
//!
//! # Reaching a torn tail deterministically
//!
//! A partial trailing batch is what `Log::open`'s tail recovery exists for, and
//! until now it was only ever fed hand-written files in unit tests. Killing a
//! process cannot be relied on to produce one: `write(2)` to a regular file is
//! not interrupted halfway by a signal, and the page cache outlives the process
//! either way. Waiting for a lucky kill would make "a torn tail is reached" a
//! claim rather than a fact.
//!
//! So the tear is made by hand, on the dead process's file, out of bytes the
//! broker itself wrote: [`tear_tail`] copies the first half of the last
//! complete batch onto the end of the segment. That is byte-for-byte the state
//! a machine that lost power mid-write leaves behind -- a header promising
//! `batch_length` bytes with fewer than that following it -- and it lands
//! strictly *after* every record the client was told was durable, so the
//! invariant under test is untouched. [`torn_tail_is_a_partial_trailing_batch`]
//! checks the tear is really a tear before the broker sees it, and the cycle
//! loop fails if no cycle ever produced one.
//!
//! # What every cycle asserts
//!
//! 1. every key the client saw acked at `acks=all` is readable after restart;
//! 2. the recovered segment walks batch-by-batch to exactly EOF, with every
//!    CRC intact -- no partial batch and no garbage left in the log.
//!
//! Half the cycles are a bare `SIGKILL` and half tear the tail as well, so both
//! recovery paths run several times in one execution.
