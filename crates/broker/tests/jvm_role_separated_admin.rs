//! Admin writes against a non-controller node in a role-separated topology.
//!
//! This is the deployment shape `KRaft` assumes and issue #82 names: one
//! controller-only node holding the quorum, plus broker-only nodes that
//! replicate metadata by fetching it and never join the voter set. A client
//! never talks to the controller-only node — it is not in the broker list —
//! so every admin write it sends lands on a node that is not the controller.
//!
//! Both tools here are driven from `mirror.gcr.io/apache/kafka:4.3.1`, the
//! same oracle image `jvm_features` uses, and both send their write to the
//! broker-only node the `Metadata` response names as controller:
//!
//! - `kafka-configs --alter` sends `IncrementalAlterConfigs` (api key 44).
//! - `kafka-features upgrade` and `downgrade` send `UpdateFeatures` (57).
//!
//! Both keys are in `ApiKeys.forwardable`, which is exactly the set a `KRaft`
//! broker wraps in a KIP-590 `Envelope`. A krabka broker-only node reaches its
//! own controller over the krabka-private `SubmitChange` RPC instead, and this
//! suite pins the client-visible outcome of that: the write succeeds and a
//! follow-up `--describe` reads it back. Without a forwarding path of any
//! kind, both tools would fail with `NOT_CONTROLLER`.
//!
//! Gated `#[ignore]` (requires Docker); run with `--ignored`.
//!
//! This suite is a manual Bazel target rather than a `container ·` CI suite,
//! and it does not pass today. A broker-only node resolves the controller
//! leader's address out of that leader's `BrokerRegistration`, a
//! controller-only node writes none, so it never heartbeats, the controller
//! fences it within one liveness tick, and every tool here fails with
//! `Timed out waiting for a node assignment` before it can say anything about
//! forwarding. `tests/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` has the full trace and the fix that is
//! needed. Nothing below is wrong; it is waiting on that fix.
