//! Cluster, topic, and membership plumbing that every KIP-932 consume test in
//! this binary shares. It starts an in-process broker whose share-coordinator
//! state topic has a single partition, creates a data topic and resolves its
//! id, produces records into it, joins a share group, and waits until the
//! group lifecycle has durably initialized the share state a consume needs.

// These single-broker tests only need one state partition. Keeping the test
// geometry small also prevents the parallel test runner from exhausting its
// process-wide file-descriptor limit while eleven brokers run concurrently.
/// Wait until the group-coordinator lifecycle hook has durably initialized the
/// share state for `(group, topic, partition)`. The persister summary then
/// becomes present. Until that happens the share coordinator is not yet
/// write-ready, and a consume's SPSO advance would not persist.
///
/// The lifecycle hook fires on each heartbeat, so this helper drives
/// steady-state heartbeats inside the wait loop rather than sleeping. It mirrors
/// the `lifecycle_initializes_share_state` pattern in `share_groups.rs`.
