//! `CodSpeed` microbenchmarks for the two costs the broker documents as
//! deliberately deferred, so that the decision to keep or fix each one rests
//! on a measured payoff and not only on an estimated price.
//!
//! **Response framing.** `encode_response` copies a handler's body to prepend
//! the 4- or 5-byte response header, and `LengthDelimitedCodec::encode` copies
//! the result again into the codec's write buffer. The deferred alternative is
//! a chained `bytes::Buf` written with one vectored write, which copies the
//! body zero times but needs a custom `Encoder<impl Buf>` and reaches every
//! `framed.send` call site in `dispatch.rs`. `bench_response_framing` runs both
//! over 1 KiB, 64 KiB and 1 MiB bodies.
//!
//! **Replicated-batch sizing.** The replicator calls
//! `RecordBatch::encoded_len` for the replication-bytes metric, and the append
//! path behind `replicate_batch` walks the same records again. The deferred
//! alternative threads one computation through the writer API.
//! `bench_replication` times the walk against the `replicate_batch` it sits in
//! front of, because the walk only matters as a fraction of that.
//!
//! `bench_ratio` prints both comparisons as a table, so a run answers the
//! keep-or-fix question without reading the criterion report.
//!
//! Both framing paths write to a sink that keeps no bytes, so the socket write
//! is excluded from both sides. What is left is the userspace copying the PERF
//! note is about, which makes the reported saving an upper bound on what the
//! refactor could deliver.
//!
//! The numbers this suite produced, and the keep-or-fix call each one settled,
//! are recorded at the two PERF notes themselves: `encode_response` in
//! `network::dispatch::response`, and the `encoded_len` walk in
//! `replicator::response`. Both came out "keep".
