//! `CodSpeed` microbenchmarks for the KIP-227 fetch-session cache.
//!
//! A broker whose session cache is full is the steady state for a large
//! consumer fleet, not an edge case: every consumer that reconnects asks for a
//! session, and every one of those allocations has to displace someone. The
//! cache answers that with the global fetch mutex held, so whatever the
//! allocation costs, every concurrent `classify` waits for it. This suite puts
//! a number on the part of that cost which used to grow with occupancy.
//!
//! The timed unit is one session's whole turn through the cache, as the fetch
//! handler drives it: `classify` on a `(session_id = 0, session_epoch = 0)`
//! request, which returns `NewSession`, then `try_allocate` for the partition
//! set the broker just served, and then the retirement that balances the
//! insertion. Building that partition set is setup, so it happens outside the
//! timer.
//!
//! Counting the retirement matters, because *where* it happens is exactly what
//! occupancy changes. In a full cache the allocation evicts, so the teardown is
//! inside `try_allocate`; below capacity nothing is displaced and the session
//! leaves later through `close`. Timing only the allocation would charge the
//! full cache for a teardown the others do off the clock, and report a slowdown
//! that is really just bookkeeping moved across the timer.
//!
//! Two axes:
//!   * **occupancy** — the cache is pre-filled to 0%, 50% or 100% of
//!     `max_incremental_fetch_session_cache_slots` before the measurement. At
//!     100% every allocation evicts, which is the case that used to scan every
//!     live session to pick its victim.
//!   * **concurrency** — 1, 8 or 64 threads share one cache, which is what
//!     puts the allocation on the critical path of everybody else's fetch.
//!
//! The two regimes still differ in one way that no arrangement can remove: a
//! full cache retires the old session inside the same lock the new one takes,
//! where the others pay for a second acquisition. That costs a few nanoseconds
//! uncontended and rather more at 64 threads, so read the single-threaded row
//! for the cost of the allocation itself and the wide rows for what contention
//! does to it.
//!
//! `bench_occupancy_ratio` prints the 100%-over-0% ratio per thread count, so
//! a run answers "does a full cache cost more to allocate into" without
//! reading the criterion report. Criterion compares a benchmark against its
//! own previous run and never against a sibling, so that number has to be
//! computed here.
