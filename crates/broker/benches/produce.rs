//! `CodSpeed` microbenchmarks for the broker's produce hot path.
//!
//! The verbatim pass-through is the design's central produce claim: a v2 batch
//! that satisfies the predicate reaches the log as the producer's own bytes,
//! with no decode, re-encode or re-CRC. The owned fallback behind it is a
//! complete second implementation, and any change that quietly widens the
//! predicate's misses moves every batch onto it. This suite puts a number on
//! that difference so the move is visible.
//!
//! Each shape runs through [`krabka_broker::produce_hot_path`], which is
//! `prepare_batch`, the writer's `build_produce_data`, and the log append
//! behind them — the same three functions the produce pipeline calls, without
//! the writer actor's hand-off.
//!
//! Three shapes, three paths:
//!   * `verbatim` — a native v2 batch on a producer-pass-through topic;
//!   * `owned` — the same bytes forced down the owned fallback;
//!   * `legacy_v1` — a v0/v1 `MessageSet`, which the fallback up-converts.
//!
//! `bench_ratio` prints the owned-over-verbatim and legacy-over-verbatim
//! ratios per shape, so a run answers "what does the fallback cost" without
//! reading the criterion report.
//!
//! `bench_produce_acks_all` measures the other axis: one Produce request
//! covering many partitions, at `acks=1` and at `acks=-1`, end to end against
//! a booted broker. The three shapes above stop at the log append and say
//! nothing about what a request pays per partition around it. The `acks=-1`
//! arm is the one that used to grow with the partition count: the handler
//! awaited each partition's high-watermark gate inline, before the next
//! partition was appended, where Kafka registers one `DelayedProduce` over the
//! whole request. The difference against the `acks=1` arm at the same
//! partition count is what that gate costs now.
