//! `CodSpeed` microbenchmarks for the broker's zero-copy fetch drain.
//!
//! A fetch response's records region reaches the socket one of two ways. The
//! vectored path (Increment C) `pread`s the region out of the segment file
//! into a buffer and writes the buffer; the sendfile path (Increments D + E)
//! hands the region's file descriptor to the kernel, which moves the pages to
//! the NIC without a userspace copy. Both produce the same wire bytes, so
//! nothing but a measurement says which is faster — and `sendfile(2)` is not
//! free: below some response size its syscall overhead costs more than the
//! copy it avoids.
//!
//! `sendfile_min` is the broker's guess at where that crossover is, and every
//! fetch is routed by it. This suite measures it. Each size drains a whole
//! response — the frame length, a response envelope, and one records region —
//! over a real loopback TCP socket with a reader draining the other end, once
//! through each path.
//!
//! Both cases pay their real per-response cost inside the timed region: the
//! vectored case runs `resolve_records_inline`, which is the `pread` the
//! broker's read path does for a run below the threshold, and the sendfile
//! case runs `resolve_records_sendfile`, which only clones the region
//! descriptor. The segment file is freshly written and so is warm in the page
//! cache, which is the state a tail read finds it in.
//!
//! What the sweep leaves out is the read planning ahead of the drain: the
//! batch-header walk (`Log::read_raw_desc`) that builds the file regions. That
//! omission does not tilt the table toward sendfile, because the walk is not
//! the sendfile path's alone. `handlers::fetch::read` runs it on every
//! sendfile-capable connection *before* it consults `sendfile_min`, so a
//! response the threshold rejects pays the walk and then pays `read_raw` on
//! top of it. Excluding the walk from both columns therefore understates the
//! vectored column's real cost, not sendfile's.
//!
//! `sendfile_min` still sits at the smallest swept size rather than below it:
//! the sweep says nothing about a response under 4 KiB, and a threshold is
//! only as good as the measurement under it.
//!
//! `bench_crossover` prints ns per response for both paths at every size, the
//! sendfile-over-vectored ratio, and the smallest swept size at which sendfile
//! wins — the number `sendfile_min`'s default has to match.
