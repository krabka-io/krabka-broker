//! `CodSpeed` microbenchmarks for the topic label a metric observation builds.
//!
//! The broker's partition registry is a nested `DashMap`
//! rather than a flat one keyed by `(String, i32)` so that resolving a
//! partition allocates nothing. The metric recorded immediately beside that
//! lookup used to allocate a `String` for its label anyway, once per
//! observation, which put the allocation back on the path the registry's shape
//! exists to keep it off. The label sets now hold an `Arc<str>` and the
//! registry hands out the copy it already keys the topic by.
//!
//! This suite puts a number on that. Two cases, one topic, one partition:
//!
//!   * `owned_string` — the previous shape, reconstructed here: a
//!     `String`-labelled counter family and a recorder that copies the topic
//!     name into a fresh label on every call;
//!   * `shared_arc` — the current shape:
//!     [`BrokerMetrics::record_replication_in`], which clones the caller's
//!     `Arc<str>` into the label.
//!
//! Everything else is held equal. Both cases hash the same bytes, find the
//! same single entry, and bump the same `Counter`, so what separates them is
//! the label's allocation and nothing else.
//!
//! `bench_ratio` prints nanoseconds per observation for both, and the ratio,
//! because criterion compares a benchmark against its own previous run and
//! never against a sibling — the before-and-after number this suite exists for
//! has to be computed here.
//!
//! Run it with `cargo bench -p krabka-broker --bench metric_labels`. This
//! repository has no benchmark CI workflow; nothing runs it for you.
