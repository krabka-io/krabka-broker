//! `CodSpeed` microbenchmarks for the thread-pool hand-off in the fetch read
//! loop.
//!
//! A consumer subscribed to many partitions turns one Fetch request into one
//! blocking log read per partition. How those reads reach a blocking thread is
//! a free choice, and the three ways of making it differ by a fixed cost per
//! read that a wide subscription pays once per partition:
//!
//!   * `spawn_blocking_per_partition` — one `spawn_blocking` per partition,
//!     awaited in turn. Every partition pays a task allocation, a queue push, a
//!     pool wakeup and a `JoinHandle` await, and the awaits serialize;
//!   * `spawn_blocking_batched` — one `spawn_blocking` for the whole pending
//!     set, which pays that cost once per fetch however wide it is;
//!   * `block_in_place` — no hand-off at all: the reads run on the reactor
//!     worker after tokio moves its other tasks to a fresh worker.
//!
//! The arms mirror `bench_append_handoff` in `krabka-log`'s suite, which
//! settled the same question for the append side, so the two sets of numbers
//! are comparable.
//!
//! The measured work is deliberately a warm read: the fetch offset is the same
//! on every iteration, so the bytes come from page cache and what remains
//! around them is the hand-off. That is the case the hand-off cost matters in.
//! A consumer that fetches 200 partitions and finds a handful of records on
//! each pays the per-partition cost 200 times over a few hundred microseconds
//! of real reading.
