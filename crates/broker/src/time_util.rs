//! Shared wall-clock time helpers, and the two guards that every cadence loop
//! puts around its injected [`Timer`].
//!
//! The wall-clock half is the single source of truth for the `SystemTime →
//! UNIX_EPOCH → as_millis() → i64` sequence that the transaction, OAuth, and
//! delegation-token handlers use, and that every reader of an injected
//! [`WallClock`](qubit_clock::WallClock) narrows through. The helpers saturate
//! on overflow and on pre-epoch clock skew, and do not panic.
//!
//! The timer half is [`arm`] and [`fired`]. Registering a deadline is fallible
//! -- a timer backend reports [`TimeError`] when it cannot take a registration
//! or cannot see one through -- and so is the completion the registration
//! yields. A cadence loop has nothing left to do once its ticker cannot be
//! armed, and re-arming it in a loop would spin the task at full speed, so both
//! helpers log the failure against the task's name and report it as "stop".
//!
//! [`system_timer`] is the real-time timer those loops run on outside tests.
