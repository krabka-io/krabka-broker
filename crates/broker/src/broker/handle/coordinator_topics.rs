//! Test-only [`BrokerHandle`] helpers that bring up a coordinator topic the
//! way a client does, then wait until the coordinator serves it.
//!
//! No broker creates `__consumer_offsets`, `__transaction_state` or
//! `__share_group_state` when it starts. A client's first `FindCoordinator`
//! asks for the topic, and the lookup answers `COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE`
//! until the topic exists and has leaders. These helpers are the counterpart
//! of Kafka's `IntegrationTestHarness.createOffsetsTopic`: a test that drives
//! a coordinator directly, or that must not spend its own deadline on the
//! first lookup, calls one of them first.
//!
//! Each helper asks for the topic again on every poll while it is absent, as
//! a retrying client does, because a creation fails while fewer brokers are
//! registered than the configured replication factor. It then waits until
//! every partition has a leader and every partition that this broker leads
//! has finished its load. In a multi-node cluster, call it on each broker
//! whose coordinator the test uses.
