/// KIP-405: compute the set of finished remote segments the topic no longer
/// keeps, in oldest-first order. The walk **stops at the first segment it
/// keeps**, so the remaining remote prefix stays contiguous.
///
/// The rule is Kafka's `RemoteLogManager.cleanupExpiredRemoteLogSegments`,
/// proved in [`krabka_verified::retention::remote_retention_prefix`]. Each
/// segment in turn goes when any of these holds, checked in this order:
/// - `md.end_offset() < deleted_below`, the log-start breach. It leaves the
///   size debt alone.
/// - `md.max_timestamp_ms < now_ms - retention`, Kafka's
///   `isSegmentBreachedByRetentionTime` against `cleanupUntilMs`; Kafka runs
///   no time axis while `now_ms - retention` is negative. It lowers the size
///   debt by the segment's size, but not below zero.
/// - The size debt, `total - retention_size`, is positive and still covers
///   the whole segment (`isSegmentBreachedByRetentionSize`). It lowers the
///   debt by the segment's size.
///
/// `total` is Kafka's `buildRetentionSizeData` total: the finished remote
/// segments' bytes plus `only_local_size`, the local bytes the remote tier
/// does not hold yet (see [`LocalLogFootprint::only_local_size`]). So
/// `retention.bytes` bounds the partition's whole footprint, and local data
/// waiting to be copied pushes the oldest remote segments out.
///
/// A `None` setting disables its axis; the log-start breach has no retention
/// setting to disable and evicts whatever falls below the floor even when both
/// retention settings are `None`. That is what makes a `DeleteRecords` on a
/// tiered topic free the remote bytes it deleted, rather than leaving them
/// listed, fetchable and billed until time or size retention happens to reach
/// them. Kafka's
/// `RemoteLogRetentionHandler.deleteLogStartOffsetBreachedSegments` is the
/// same rule.
///
/// `deleted_below` is the floor **someone deleted up to**, not whatever the
/// partition's `log_start_offset` currently reads: a floor merely inferred
/// from the segments left on disk at `Log::open` sits above the whole archive
/// on a partition whose local segments were evicted, and breaching against it
/// would delete the archive on every restart. A `None` disables the axis.
///
/// The caller must already have filtered to `CopySegmentFinished` and sorted
/// by `start_offset`.
///
/// [`ArchiveMode::WriteOnce`] evicts nothing, whatever the topic's retention
/// settings and log start say: remote retention is a delete, and a write-once
/// archive has none to give.
