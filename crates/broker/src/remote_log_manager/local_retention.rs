//! Local-retention eviction: which copied sealed segments a replica may drop
//! from its own disk once the remote tier holds them.
//!
//! Leader and follower alike run this pass. What makes a sealed segment
//! droppable is the RLMM saying the leader finished copying the offsets it
//! holds, and the RLMM is shared, so a follower reaches the same answer over
//! its own disk that the leader reaches over the leader's.
//!
//! The question is asked in offsets, never in segment boundaries. A replica
//! rolls its own segments, so a follower's segment need not line up with the
//! leader's; [`remote_covered_through`] turns the RLMM listing into the one
//! offset the tier holds an unbroken copy through, and nothing past it is
//! droppable on any replica.
//!
//! The walk ends at the active segment, which the remote tier never holds.
//! When it gets there and the active segment breaches the window too, the
//! pass rolls it, as Kafka's `deletableSegments` does, so that the next copy
//! uploads its records and the next pass drops them. Without the roll a
//! partition that stops taking writes keeps its newest records on local disk
//! until `segment.ms` or `segment.bytes` rolls the segment.
//!
//! The pure walk that picks the deletion target and the roll sits beside the
//! pass that applies them, because they share one contiguous-prefix rule.
