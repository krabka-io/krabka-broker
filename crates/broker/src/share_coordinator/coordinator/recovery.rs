//! The load of a led `__share_group_state` partition: a replay of its log
//! into the in-memory delivery state.
//!
//! [`ShareCoordinator::refresh_leader_partitions`] starts one load task for
//! each partition that this broker starts to lead. The task folds every
//! `ShareSnapshot`, `ShareUpdate`, and tombstone record of the partition into
//! a private map. It installs the map and marks the partition active only if
//! no newer term of the partition started in the meantime. This path only
//! reads the log, so it lives apart from the write path in `persist`.
