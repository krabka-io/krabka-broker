//! Per-broker `ShareCoordinator`, the KIP-932 persister.
//!
//! The coordinator owns the in-memory delivery state for each
//! `(group, topicId, partition)` of every `__share_group_state` partition that
//! this broker hosts as leader. It writes each state change as a
//! `ShareSnapshot` or `ShareUpdate` record in the matching
//! `__share_group_state` partition. It replays a partition when it becomes the
//! leader of it.
//!
//! This coordinator mirrors [`crate::txn::coordinator::TxnCoordinator`].
//!
//! Leadership follows Kafka's `CoordinatorRuntime`. When this broker becomes
//! the leader of a `__share_group_state` partition (a new entry in the
//! metadata image, or a new leader epoch), the coordinator drops the keys of
//! that partition and replays its log in a background task. Until the replay
//! ends, every state-machine method answers `COORDINATOR_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS` for
//! the keys of that partition. When the broker stops leading the partition,
//! the coordinator drops the keys and answers `NOT_COORDINATOR`.
//!
//! Each state-machine method holds a read guard on the leadership map from
//! its status check to its last in-memory change. A load or an unload takes
//! the write guard, so it never interleaves with an operation that is still
//! running on the same partition.
//!
//! An operation answers only when the records of its partition are
//! committed, as a write of Kafka's `CoordinatorRuntime` does. The coordinator
//! appends a record only while the partition leads locally at the leader epoch
//! of the term, and it stamps that epoch on the batch. It applies the record
//! to the in-memory state at once, as the runtime replays a record when it
//! appends it. It then releases the read guard and waits until the high
//! watermark covers the last record that the term wrote. If the partition
//! gets a new leader or a new leader epoch before that, the operation answers
//! `NOT_COORDINATOR`. If the wait takes longer than
//! `share.coordinator.write.timeout.ms`, it answers `COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE`.
//!
//! This file holds the coordinator's identity: the shared types, the struct,
//! and the leadership and partitioning accessors. The state machine lives in
//! `state_machine`, the durable append and the log prune in `persist`, and the
//! log replay in `recovery`.
