/// The check is the controller's own, [`krabka_raft::metadata_log_nonempty`],
/// so this choice can never disagree with `Controller::start_with_listener`'s
/// mode validation. `KraftController::open` creates an empty active segment
/// before the first commit, and a node killed mid-election on a multi-node
/// cold start has that segment but no `quorum-state`. It reads as fresh and
/// re-Bootstraps, rather than picking Rejoin and dying with "Rejoin requires
/// non-empty raft log" in a crashloop.
