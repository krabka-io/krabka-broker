/// Runs `work`, and ends it with [`BrokerError::FatalFault`] as soon as

///
/// `faults` is [`MetadataSource::watch_fatal`](crate::metadata_source::MetadataSource::watch_fatal).
/// Kafka's `ProcessTerminatingFaultHandler` halts the process the moment the
/// controller replays a fault such as a `FeatureLevelRecord` above its
/// supported range. A start that carries on after that fault only delays the
/// halt: a submit against the stopped controller retries under backoff for
/// seconds, and the wait for the first unfence lasts minutes for a heartbeat
/// that a dead controller cannot answer. The fault ends the work at once
/// instead, and the caller reports it.
///
/// A failure of `work` that comes after a fault reports the fault as well. The
/// controller publishes the fault before it stops, so the failure is a bare
/// `controller shut down` that the fault caused, and the fault names the
/// reason.
///
/// A channel that closes without a fault is a controller that stopped in an
/// orderly way, or a source that has none. That is no fault, and `work` runs
/// on.
