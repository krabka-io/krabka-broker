//! The observer's serve loop: it picks a controller, fetches from it, records
//! the applied offset and the leader the answer names, and parks on the poll
//! interval whenever it is caught up or the controller is unreachable.
//!
//! The controllers it picks from are the voters and bootstrap servers that
//! [`quorum_targets`] lists, read again before every fetch. A node in a KIP-853
//! dynamic quorum starts with bootstrap servers alone and learns the voters,
//! and the endpoint of the leader, from the records it applies.
//!
//! The loop starts from what this node last checkpointed rather than from
//! offset 0, and checkpoints again as it advances, so a restart does not replay
//! the whole metadata log — and does not ask a pruned controller for records it
//! no longer holds.
