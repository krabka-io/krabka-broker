//! Public catalog of the Kafka protocol APIs this broker advertises.
//!
//! This is the single source of truth for both the live `ApiVersions`
//! (`api_key` 18) response and the generated protocol-API reference page. The
//! handler in `handlers::api_versions` calls [`supported_apis`] with the kind
//! of listener the request arrived on, the broker's KIP-714 setting and its
//! [`VersionGates`], so a listener a client reaches advertises what a Kafka
//! broker advertises. Under the default gates that is exactly Kafka 4.3.1's
//! table: [`CatalogApi::released`], from [`krabka_raft::KAFKA_4_3_1_APIS`], is
//! the one per-API record of what that release serves, and both the
//! advertised range and the receive-side refusal ([`is_disabled_version`])
//! are derived from it. The dispatch registry calls [`dispatched_apis`] instead, because what the broker
//! serves is wider than what any one listener names. `krabka-docgen` reads the
//! same list and does not spawn the broker binary.
//!
//! It is also the source of truth for the per-KIP rows of the generated
//! `docs/KIP_MATRIX.md`. [`KIP_ANNOTATIONS`] holds one [`KipAnnotation`] per
//! KIP that any file under `crates/` names. `aspect generate-kip-matrix`
//! parses that table as text, between the `BEGIN KIP_ANNOTATIONS` and
//! `END KIP_ANNOTATIONS` marker comments, and fails when a KIP appears in
//! `crates/` without a row here, when a row names a KIP that no file mentions,
//! or when a row points at a module or test that does not exist. Keep each
//! entry in the literal shape the existing ones use: the generator does not
//! compile Rust.

Kafka trunk's four newest topic keys (`remote.copy.lag.ms`, `remote.copy.lag.bytes`, `max.decompressed.message.bytes`, `errors.deadletterqueue.group.enable`) are unknown topic configs by default, as they are on 4.3.1, so a replay from a trunk cluster that sets one fails as it does against a 4.3.1 broker; `unstable.api.versions.enable` accepts and describes them.",

An inline flag group naming a flag RE2J has no equivalent for (`x`, `u`, `R`) is rejected ahead of the compile with RE2J's own message, since `regex` would take it. Two residues remain, both documented on `check_subscribed_topic_regex`: `regex` character-class set operations are accepted where RE2J would not, and RE2's literal-quoting escape pair, which `regex` has no equivalent for, is rejected where RE2J would accept. Neither can change which topics an accepted subscription matches.
