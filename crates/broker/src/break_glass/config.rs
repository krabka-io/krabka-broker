//! The runtime view of `[break_glass]`.
//!
//! [`crate::config::BreakGlassConfig`] holds the parsed and validated values.
//! The file-config layer already refused a `required_approvals` below two, a
//! `signed_actions` entry that names no action, a `signed_actions` entry with
//! no operator key, and a malformed duration. This
//! module answers only the three questions the workflow asks of that
//! configuration at run time: is the workflow on, is this principal an
//! approver, and does this action need a signature.
//!
//! # The approver set is a per-node value
//!
//! `approvers` comes from each broker's own `broker.toml`, and not from the
//! metadata log, because an attacker who can write the metadata log must not be
//! able to add themselves to the set that authorizes a data-losing operation.
//! Two brokers can then disagree during a rolling configuration change, and
//! nothing in the cluster reconciles them. [`BreakGlassPolicy::fingerprint`]
//! is what makes a disagreement visible after the fact: every break-glass audit
//! event carries it.
