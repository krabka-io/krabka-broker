//! KFC-9: the break-glass two-person rule over the privileged transitions.
//!
//! A privileged transition can lose committed data, or can lift the protection
//! that stops another transition from losing committed data. Break-glass makes
//! two different people agree before the broker does one. An operator opens a
//! proposal, a second operator approves it, and the approved proposal is then a
//! standing authorization for a bounded window.
//!
//! The approved proposal is not a field on the request it authorizes. No Kafka
//! request gains a field for this feature. An operator gets the approval out of
//! band through the three private APIs, then runs the ordinary JVM tool, and
//! the gated handler looks for the approval in its own metadata image.
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! | Module | Purpose |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`config`] | the runtime view of `[break_glass]` |
//! | [`signing`] | the canonical bytes that an approval signature covers |
//! | [`gate`] | find an approved proposal and stamp it consumed |
//! | [`handlers`] | api keys 1017, 1018, and 1019 |
//! | [`metrics`] | the `break_glass_*` metric families |
//! | [`sweep`] | the background reaper for expired proposals |
//!
//! # The action vocabulary
//!
//! [`krabka_metadata::BreakGlassAction`] is the one definition of the gated
//! set. This module maps it to the two forms the rest of the code needs: the
//! wire value that the private APIs carry, and the name that `signed_actions`,
//! the audit event, and the metric label all use. There is no second action
//! enum. [`crate::metrics::BreakGlassAction`] is a newtype over this one,
//! because the orphan rule keeps the metric-label trait off a foreign enum,
//! and it renders through [`action_name`].
//!
//! # Consumption is atomic with the transition
//!
//! [`gate::authorize`] returns the consumed proposal record. A metadata-backed
//! action puts it in the same `submit_change` call as its own records. A local
//! action commits it first through [`persistence`]. Both paths prevent the
//! action from starting while the approval remains reusable.
