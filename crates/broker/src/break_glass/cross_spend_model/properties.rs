//! The stateright [`Model`] impl: how the state graph is enumerated, and what
//! must hold at every state in it.
//!
//! One file holds the whole impl because a trait impl cannot be split across
//! modules. It supplies the initial universe, the step alphabet, the dispatch
//! into [`CrossSpendModel`]'s transitions, the safety and non-vacuity
//! properties, and the boundary that keeps the search finite. The module doc
//! of [`cross_spend_model`](super) says what each property is worth.
