//! The raft append a gated metadata transition accumulates, and the audit trail
//! that append owes once its outcome is known.
//!
//! `ElectLeaders` and `AlterPartitionReassignments` both gate a per-partition
//! transition on a break-glass approval and both commit every consumed proposal
//! in the same raft append as the partition records it authorized. They differ
//! only in the action they spend and the wording of their audit events, so
//! [`GatedBatch`] takes those as data.
