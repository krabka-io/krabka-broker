//! `ApproveBreakGlass`, api key 1018.
//!
//! One request adds one approval to a break-glass proposal, or withdraws the
//! proposal. The `withdraw` flag picks between the two, which follows
//! `AlterableBarrierGroup` and its `delete` flag.
//!
//! Authorization: `Alter` on `Cluster("kafka-cluster")`. A denied request
//! answers `CLUSTER_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED` (31).
//!
//! # Three checks make it a two-person rule
//!
//! The approver must be in `break_glass.approvers`, must not be the proposer,
//! and must not already appear in the approval list. Without all three the rule
//! is a two-click rule.
//!
//! # The broker reads the approver set here, and not when it acts
//!
//! `break_glass.approvers` comes from each broker's own file. This handler is
//! the only place that reads it. The gate that spends an approval never reads
//! it again, for two reasons.
//!
//! A second check at consumption time would make the consume non-deterministic
//! across brokers. The set is a per-node file value, and two nodes can
//! legitimately disagree during a rolling configuration change. Two brokers have
//! to reach the same answer about one record.
//!
//! The operator-facing consequence is also the right one. An operator who
//! removes a person stops that person from making new approvals. The removal
//! does not silently invalidate an incident response that is already under way.
//! The safety bound is `break_glass.proposal_ttl`: wait it out, and every
//! pending approval by that principal is dead.
//!
//! Each audit event records
//! [`BreakGlassPolicy::fingerprint`](crate::break_glass::config::BreakGlassPolicy::fingerprint),
//! so a broker that disagrees with its peers about the set is visible in the
//! audit log after the fact.
