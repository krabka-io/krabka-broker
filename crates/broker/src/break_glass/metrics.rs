//! The `break_glass_*` metric families, fed from the metadata image.
//!
//! Three families cover the workflow. `break_glass_proposals` is a gauge over
//! the four proposal states, and a watch on the metadata image refreshes it.
//! `break_glass_refusals` counts the gated transitions the broker refused for
//! want of an approval. `break_glass_bypassed` counts the privileged
//! transitions the broker did with no approval at all, and it is the family an
//! operator should alert on, because it counts data-losing transitions that no
//! second person agreed to.
//!
//! Every label set is bounded. The `action` label takes one of the seven action
//! names, and the `state` label takes one of the four state names.
