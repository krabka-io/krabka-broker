//! Exhaustive stateright enumeration of one proposal's whole lifecycle.
//!
//! The model drives the REAL decision code. Each transition builds a
//! [`BreakGlassProposalRecord`] out of the model state and calls
//! [`approve::decide`](crate::break_glass::handlers::approve::decide) for an
//! approval and a withdrawal, and
//! [`gate::authorize`](crate::break_glass::gate::authorize) for a consume,
//! against a real [`MetadataImage`]. A rule that the model checks is therefore
//! the rule the broker runs, and not a second copy of it.
//!
//! The alphabet is every interleaving of approve, withdraw, expire, and
//! consume, over a tiny universe of principals. The two headline properties are
//! the promises the feature makes:
//!
//! - `no_double_spend`: no interleaving consumes one proposal twice. One
//!   approval authorizes one transition.
//! - `no_under_approved`: no interleaving consumes a proposal that fewer than
//!   `required_approvals` distinct principals approved. A rule about people
//!   cannot be satisfied by one person acting twice.
//!
//! The clock is a small integer of logical milliseconds. The proposal is
//! created at zero and expires at [`EXPIRES_AT`], and an expire action advances
//! the clock by one. The bound keeps the state graph exhaustive.
