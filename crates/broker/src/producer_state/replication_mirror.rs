//! A transaction marker a follower learns through replication must update the
//! produce-path tracker exactly as a marker this broker appends as leader
//! does.
//!
//! `WriterMessage::Replicate` is the only path a control batch reaches on a
//! follower: `replicator/response.rs` decodes every control batch (raw or
//! `V2`) and sends it through `Partition::replicate_batch`, never through
//! `ReplicateVerbatim`. Without mirroring on that arm, the follower's tracker
//! keeps an empty or pre-marker entry after a transaction-version-2 marker
//! until a promotion copies the log's producer state: an old-epoch retry the
//! marker fenced could be accepted, and an empty tracker accepts any first
//! sequence, not only 0.
