//! The KIP-966 eligible-leader-replica state the search carries, and the seam
//! onto the real maintenance rule that computes it.
//!
//! # Why the model has to maintain it rather than stipulate it
//!
//! [`failover_one`](crate::leader_election::failover_one) elects a surviving
//! ELR member once the live ISR has emptied, ahead of a longer log and of both
//! the offset-aware recovery and the KIP-841 election, and reports that
//! election as clean; [`select_leader`](crate::unclean_recovery::select_leader)
//! makes the same ranking inside a recovery. That report is not an
//! observation, it is a claim about how
//! the set was built: an ELR member left the ISR while the partition still met
//! `min.insync.replicas`, and the leader's high watermark does not move while
//! the partition is below it, so every committed record was already on it. A
//! model that let the search pick the ELR out
//! of thin air would refute the claim on its first step, and would refute it
//! for a partition no controller could ever produce. So the model runs the
//! production rule instead: every transition that changes the leader or the
//! ISR calls the real
//! [`next_partition_elr`](crate::elr::maintain::next_partition_elr), the same
//! function [`ElrPublisher`](crate::elr::ElrPublisher) drives before it writes the
//! topic config, and the set the search carries is whatever that returns.
//!
//! # What the state carries, and what it leaves out
//!
//! [`DpState::elr`](super::state::DpState::elr) is the published
//! eligible-leader set as a broker bitmask. The published *last-known* ELR is
//! deliberately absent. It holds the last leader of a partition that has none,
//! and this model's failover applies nothing to such a partition (`Unavailable`
//! changes no state here), so the search never reaches the state in which an
//! election reads it. While a partition has a leader,
//! `next_partition_elr` derives the eligible set from `old_isr ∪ elr` alone,
//! so passing the last-known half back as empty yields the same eligible set
//! on every call, at a fraction of the reachable states. It is a
//! `DescribeTopicPartitions` field, and [`crate::elr::maintain`]'s own tests
//! are where it is checked.
