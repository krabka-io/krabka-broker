// The exact unique-state count of the exhaustive BFS over each config below.
// `unique_state_count()` is deterministic for a fixed model, so pinning it
// turns any change to the reachable set -- a dropped action, a `next_state` arm
// that starts returning `None`, a derived `Hash`/`PartialEq` that stops
// considering a field -- into a failure instead of a silently smaller search
// that still passes the upper bound. The *generated* count is deliberately not
// pinned: it depends on dedupe timing across the BFS worker threads.
// CLEAN moved from 521,626, UNCLEAN from 1,255,681 and ELR from 2,795,492
// when the leader's high watermark took Kafka's rule and the model's ISR
// expansion took the real `isr_candidate_selected` kernel. The watermark now
// never falls within a leadership and a new leader keeps the one it inherited
// (it used to be recomputed from scratch and could drop back), which splits
// states the old model merged, so CLEAN and UNCLEAN grew. It also stands still
// while the ISR is under `min.insync.replicas`, and a follower rejoins only
// once its log reaches the start of the leader's epoch, which removes the
// under-min-ISR commits and the early re-admissions ELR used to enumerate, so
// ELR shrank.
