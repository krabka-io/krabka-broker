//! The controller's reaction to a broker that went down, and the state change
//! an election leaves behind.
//!
//! `do_failover` projects the model state onto a `PartitionRecord` and lets
//! the real `failover_one` — and, on the KIP-966 empty-ISR path, the real
//! `select_leader` — take the decision. It hands `failover_one` the
//! eligible-leader set the model has been maintaining, exactly as the
//! production scan hands it the published one, so a partition whose live ISR
//! has emptied elects a surviving ELR member cleanly before either the
//! offset-aware recovery or the KIP-841 election is consulted.
//!
//! Every election then goes through [`apply_elect`], which is split by the
//! [`Rule`] that chose the leader, because each rule owes the durability
//! ghosts something different. It is the only place where committed data can
//! be declared lost, so the loss characterisation sits next to the election
//! that causes it.
//!
//! # The obligation an ELR election answers to
//!
//! An ELR election is reported as losing nothing: `failover_one` returns it
//! with `unclean: false`, and `select_leader` returns it with a basis whose
//! `ElectionBasis::loses_data` is `false` -- the predicate the
//! unclean-election counter, the audit reason and KFC-9's `require` gate all
//! read. That report is the claim this model exists to check.
//!
//! `committed` is everything that ever reached the HWM, the obligation a
//! consumer sees. The leader's high watermark stands still while the ISR is
//! under `min.insync.replicas`, as Kafka's `Partition.maybeIncrementLeaderHW`
//! does, so every committed record reached the HWM while at least min ISR
//! replicas held it -- and KIP-966 names a replica eligible exactly when it
//! left an ISR that was about to fall below min ISR. An ELR member therefore
//! holds every committed record, and an ELR election may drop none of them:
//! that is the `elr_election_keeps_every_committed_record` property. Only an
//! election reported as losing data may shorten `committed`.
