//! The seam onto the real high-watermark core: it rebuilds a `ReplicaState`
//! from the model state and asks the production code where the watermark
//! belongs.
//!
//! Both release paths live here, because they answer the same question from
//! different durability evidence. The replicated path takes the minimum
//! in-sync-replica log end offset, and the diskless path takes the fsynced
//! write-ahead-log prefix. `consistent_leo` sits with them: it is the reason
//! the replicated answer is sound, since a follower that has not reconciled a
//! divergence must not count toward the watermark.
