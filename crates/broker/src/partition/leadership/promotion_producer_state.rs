//! A promotion copies the producer state of the log into the produce-path
//! tracker.
//!
//! A Kafka follower updates its producer state for each batch it replicates
//! (`UnifiedLog.appendAsFollower`). A new leader thus answers a retry of a
//! replicated batch as a duplicate (`ProducerStateEntry.findDuplicateBatch`),
//! and it takes the next sequence after that batch. A follower's tracker does
//! not see replicated data batches, so `Partition::install_local_leadership`
//! copies them from the log. Whatever the tracker held before the promotion,
//! the new leader decides from the producer state at its log end.
