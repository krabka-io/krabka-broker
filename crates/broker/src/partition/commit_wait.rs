//! The commit wait of an `acks=-1` append that this broker made as the
//! partition's leader.
//!
//! Kafka completes such an append in `DelayedProduce` once the high watermark
//! covers it. The append fails when the broker stops leading the partition
//! first: `ReplicaManager.makeFollowers` completes every delayed produce of the
//! partition with `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER`. The high watermark alone does not
//! prove a commit. A former leader that follows the new leader takes the high
//! watermark of the new leader, and that watermark can pass the offset of the
//! append over records that replaced it.
//!
//! The group coordinator's `__consumer_offsets` writes and the transaction
//! markers both wait here. Each caller says what its term is.
