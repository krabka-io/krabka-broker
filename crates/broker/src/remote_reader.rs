//! KIP-405 remote read path.
//!
//! This module wraps the broker's shared [`RemoteStorageManager`] and
//! [`RemoteLogMetadataManager`] pair. It serves `Fetch` and `ListOffsets`
//! requests for offsets that have no local copy any more.
//!
//! The RSM and RLMM SPIs are synchronous and blocking. This module therefore
//! wraps byte-range reads, index reads, and `ListOffsets` metadata scans in
//! `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, so those remote-tier operations do not stall
//! the broker's reactor. It decodes the fetched bytes with
//! [`krabka_remote_storage::index`], whose lookups mirror
//! `krabka_log::index::{OffsetIndex,TimeIndex}::lookup` against the Kafka-format
//! index bytes that the copy path wrote verbatim.
