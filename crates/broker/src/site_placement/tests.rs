//! Tests for the stretch-cluster replica placement: Kafka's striped placement
//! for a cluster without a site, the random start of both placements, the
//! site spread and its rotation, the preferred-site and witness rules for
//! `replicas[0]`, the last-resort use of fenced brokers, and the requests that
//! must return no assignment at all.
//!
//! They sit in their own file because checking the rules takes about as many
