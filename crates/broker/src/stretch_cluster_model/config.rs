//! The bounded cluster shape that the model checks: the sites, the brokers,
//! the replica list that the real placement produced, and the proved

//! This module is separate because the shape is fixed before the search
//! begins. Everything here is decided once, in [`StretchModel::new`], and the
//! transition modules then only read it.
