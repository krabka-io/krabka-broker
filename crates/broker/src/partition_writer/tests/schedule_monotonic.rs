//! Writer-loop tests for KFC-1 `delivery.schedule.monotonic`, which the log
//! enforces under the lock that writes the batch.
//!
//! The writer batches up to `max_produce_group` queued jobs into one
//! `append_produce_batch` call, so a rule checked anywhere above the writer is
//! a rule two jobs of one group can walk straight past. These tests drive that
//! exact shape: two produces, one group, descending delivery times.
