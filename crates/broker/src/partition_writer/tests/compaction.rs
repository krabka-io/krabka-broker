//! Writer-loop tests for the Compact arm: the batches that a compaction pass
//! keeps for the producers of a partition, on a leader and on a follower.
//!
//! Kafka's cleaner reads the last record of each active producer from the
//! producer state of the log: `Cleaner.cleanSegments` calls
//! `UnifiedLog.lastRecordsOfActiveProducers`. A leader updates that state for
//! each batch that it appends, and a follower for each batch that it
//! replicates, so the two replicas keep the same batches.
