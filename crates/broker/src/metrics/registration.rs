/// Produce/Fetch band (0.5ms–50ms) lands on distinct buckets.
///
/// The `request_{local,remote,throttle}_duration_seconds` phases and
/// `quota_throttle_duration_seconds` share these boundaries deliberately. A
/// phase is a part of the total, and an operator checks the phases against the
/// total bucket by bucket; two bucket sets would make that comparison an
