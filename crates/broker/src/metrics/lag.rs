//! The two "how far behind" gauges — per-follower replica lag and
//! per-(group, topic, partition) consumer-group lag — the index that makes
//! their series releasable, and the publish entry points their samplers call.
//!
//! Both families are sampled rather than incremented: a pass computes the
//! whole set of label sets it can justify and hands it over at once, so
//! publishing is also what releases the series the pass no longer justifies.
//! That is the same rule `share_partition::backlog_poller` follows for the
//! share-group backlog gauge.
//!
//! The index exists because releasing a series is not always the sampler's
//! job. A group is deleted, a coordinator loses an offsets partition, a topic
//! is deleted, a partition is reassigned away: each of those knows part of a
//! lag label set and none of them knows the rest.
//! `prometheus_client::metrics::family::Family` cannot be enumerated, so
//! without a record of the live label sets those callers have no way to reach
//! the series they must release, and the highest-cardinality family in the
//! broker would keep them until the next pass — or, once the sampler stops
//! naming the group at all, forever.
