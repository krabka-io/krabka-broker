//! Release of the per-partition and per-topic series that a reassigned
//! partition or a deleted topic leaves behind.
//!
//! `Family::get_or_create` materialises a series on first produce, fetch,
//! replication or compaction, and `prometheus-client` never releases one on
//! its own. Without this module the `/metrics` body grows for the life of the
//! process on any cluster that reassigns partitions or deletes topics: nine
//! per-partition series and a dozen per-topic series stay in the body for a
//! partition this broker no longer hosts.
//!
//! The current metadata image is the bound. A partition's series live while
//! this broker sits in that partition's replica set, and a topic's series live
//! while that topic exists. [`MetricSeriesIndex`] records what the data path
//! actually materialised, including rejected client-supplied names, so a pass
//! can release labels no image ever named. The pass also runs periodically to
//! catch a write racing just behind an image update. The index contains live
//! series rather than tombstones, so it has the registry's current bound.
//!
//! Kafka's `BrokerTopicMetrics` marks a rejected request under the topic name
//! the client supplied. Krabka keeps that accounting: handlers create and
//! increment the series before reconciliation. Unlike Kafka's process-lifetime
//! sensor, an unjustified label is then collected on the next pass (within 30
//! seconds), which bounds hostile names without moving rejected traffic onto a
//! synthetic label or silently dropping it at the handler.
//!
//! Five further families are keyed by a partition without taking a
//! [`PartitionLabel`], and each is left to a narrower owner that releases it
//! sooner than this diff could. `share_group_backlog` is pruned by
//! `share_partition::backlog_poller` on its own tick. The four diskless WAL
//! gauges -- `diskless_wal_durable_watermark`,
//! `diskless_wal_index_projection_lag`, `diskless_wal_trim_frontier` and
//! `diskless_wal_voter_lag` -- are keyed by topic id and released by
//! `wal::quorum::registry::WalShardRegistry`, whose `replace_placements`
//! reconfigures every live shard engine against the newest image and whose
//! `remove` clears a shard the supervisor tore down. Routing those through
//! [`BrokerMetrics::evict_partition_series`] would be wrong as well as
//! redundant: a shard's voters are selected from the registered brokers rather
//! than from the partition's replica set, so this broker can still vote on --
//! and still report lag for -- a shard whose replicas no longer name it.
//!
//! The two lag families of `metrics::lag` are keyed that way too, and they
//! join in here rather than being left to a narrower owner. Their samplers
//! already release what a pass stops naming, but a reassignment or a topic
//! delete must not wait for the next pass, and a group that leaves this
//! coordinator is never named by a pass again. Each entry point below reaches
//! the families its own rule justifies: the per-partition one covers replica
//! lag, because "this broker left the replica set" is exactly what ends a
//! follower's series, while consumer-group lag follows the group rather than
//! the host and so is reached only by the per-topic entry point and by
//! `evict_group_series`, which gives group removal -- an event no image
//! records -- its own one call to make.
