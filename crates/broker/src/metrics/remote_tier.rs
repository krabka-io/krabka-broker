//! KIP-405 tiered-storage traffic and lag, and the KIP-73 replication
//! byte-rate counters.
//!
//! Kafka publishes the tier's traffic under
//! `kafka.server:type=BrokerTopicMetrics`, per topic and in aggregate:
//! `RemoteCopyBytesPerSec`, `RemoteFetchBytesPerSec`, the three
//! `Remote*RequestsPerSec` meters, the three `Remote*ErrorsPerSec` meters and
//! the four `Remote*Lag*` gauges. The names are in
//! `org.apache.kafka.server.log.remote.storage.RemoteStorageMetrics`. Without
//! them, an operator whose object store starts returning 503s learns about it
//! from consumer lag rather than from the broker.
//!
//! Lag is what the tier has not caught up on: for the copy path, the sealed
//! local segments past the highest finished copy; for the delete path, the
//! remote segments a retention pass has decided to remove and not yet
//! removed. Kafka records both at the top of the task that will do the work,
//! which is where these are recorded too, so a stuck tier shows a lag that
//! climbs rather than a rate that merely stops.
//!
//! The KIP-73 counters are the byte-rate `ReplicationQuotaManager` publishes
//! as `kafka.server:type=LeaderReplication,name=byte-rate` and its
//! `FollowerReplication` twin: the measured throttled-replication rate an
//! operator watches during a reassignment to see whether the throttle is
//! biting. They are counters here rather than rates because Prometheus takes
//! the derivative itself.
