//! Broker incarnation ID persistence.
//!
//! A UUID, the `incarnation_id`, identifies a broker in its
//! `BrokerRegistration`. The broker generates the UUID once on first boot,
//! writes it to `{log_dir}/incarnation_id` as a lowercase hyphenated UUID, and
//! reloads it on every subsequent start.
//!
//! ## Not part of the strict on-disk contract
//!
//! The file has no version marker, and an unreadable value is replaced with a
//! fresh UUID rather than refused. That is deliberate. The id is a
//! regenerable identity, not durable state:
//!
//! - Kafka never persists it. `BrokerLifecycleManager` draws a new
//!   `Uuid.randomUuid()` for every process, so every Kafka restart presents a
//!   new incarnation, and the controller is built to accept that.
//! - Nothing fences on it across processes. Self-registration always submits
//!   a new registration at epoch `-1`, which the controller stamps with a
//!   fresh broker epoch whatever the incarnation; the incarnation check in
//!   the controller's amend path guards only an amend of a registration this
//!   same process made. The broker epoch, not the incarnation, fences the
//!   previous process, and the clean-shutdown proof (see
//!   `crate::clean_shutdown`), not the incarnation, decides whether a restart
//!   was clean.
//! - The worst a new id costs is Kafka's ordinary restart behavior: a
//!   `BrokerRegistration` under a new incarnation is refused with
//!   `DUPLICATE_BROKER_REGISTRATION` until the previous incarnation's
//!   heartbeat session expires.
//!
//! So a later 1.x build that changes this file's shape needs no reader for the
//! old one: an older build that cannot parse it regenerates the id, which is
//! exactly what a Kafka broker does on every start.
