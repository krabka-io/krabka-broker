//! Exhaustive stateright models of the controller leader-failover decision
//! (`failover_one`) and the KIP-966 winner selection (`select_leader`). See
//! `crates/broker/docs/replication-isr-design.md`.
//!
//! Each failover configuration also runs with a data-bearing witness in the
//! replica set. The witness stays in every emitted ISR, and no reachable state
//! has a witness leader.
//!
//! The failover search moves brokers down and up, runs the real
//! `failover_one` over the partition, and re-admits a revived follower to the
//! ISR through the real leader-side and controller-side ISR decisions, so a
//! partition does not stay at the singleton ISR its first out-of-ISR election
//! left. After every change it recomputes the published KIP-966
//! eligible-leader set with the real maintenance rule and hands that set to
//! the next `failover_one`. Every configuration checks that each decision
//! took the highest rung the pre-state offered, so neither the offset-aware
//! recovery nor the KIP-841 election is chosen while a lossless rung was open,
//! and that it removed only the dead broker from the ISR, as Kafka's
//! `handleBrokerFenced` does. No reachable state has a leader outside its ISR,
//! even when a follower's failover runs while the leader is down and its own
//! failover has not.
//! At `min.insync.replicas` 1 the rule publishes a set only for an ISR that
//! has emptied outright; the `failover_*elr*` configurations run at 2, where a
//! replica leaves the ISR into the set in the ordinary course, and witness
//! that the ELR rung is taken.
//!
//! The winner-selection model runs once per published eligible-leader set, and
//! checks the ordering the KIP-966 rule imposes: which replica is elected out
//! of which group, and whether the election reports itself as losing data. It
//! holds no logs, so it cannot check that the replica so elected really is
//! complete -- that claim is about ELR maintenance, and `data_path_model`'s
//! `data_elr` configuration is where it is checked. See [`recovery_model`] for
//! the split.
//!
//! Memory safety: stateright BFS keeps every visited unique state resident, so
//! `within_boundary` + `target_state_count` fence each run. You MUST run these
//! models under the host memory watchdog while you tune the bounds.
//!
//! # Module layout
//!
//! This file is the module root. It holds the checked configurations, one per
//! test. Each child holds one concern: [`failover_state`] the failover search
//! space and its projection onto a `PartitionRecord`, [`elr`] the seam onto
//! the real ELR maintenance rule, [`decision`] the
//! safety invariants of one `failover_one` result, [`failover_model`] the
//! stateright [`Model`](stateright::Model) implementation that drives them,
//! [`recovery_state`] and [`recovery_model`] the same pair for KIP-966 winner
//! selection, and [`runner`] the checker bounds.

// This root is itself reached through a `#[path]` declaration in
// `leader_election`, which makes it a module-directory owner, so a bare
// `mod child;` would resolve against `src/` instead of this file's stem
// directory. Each child therefore names its file explicitly.
