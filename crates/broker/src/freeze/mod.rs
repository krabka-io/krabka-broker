//! The topic write-freeze registry (KFC-9).
//!
//! A write freeze is a cluster state that no ACL can express. The cluster is
//! up, reads work, and replication runs, but the broker refuses every append
//! that puts new client-authored data into a frozen topic's log. Incident
//! response, migrations, and disaster-recovery promotion each need that state.
//!
//! The registry itself lives in the metadata log as
//! [`krabka_metadata::TopicFreezeRecord`], and
//! [`MetadataImage::topic_freeze`][krabka_metadata::MetadataImage::topic_freeze]
//! holds the index that resolves a topic name to the entry that covers it.
//! This module is the broker half: the produce-path resolver, the signature
//! layer, and the two control-plane RPCs.
//!
//! # Key Modules
//!
//! - [`resolve`] answers "is this topic frozen" for the produce path.
//! - [`signing`] builds the canonical bytes of a freeze record and verifies
//!   the detached operator signature over them.
//! - [`handlers`] is the wire surface: `SetTopicFreeze` (1015) and
//!   `DescribeTopicFreezes` (1016).
//!
//! # A freeze takes one command, and a thaw takes two people
//!
//! A freeze needs no break-glass approval, because an operator must reach it
//! in one command during an incident and freezing is the safe direction. A
//! thaw needs an approved proposal and a signature, because a freeze that one
//! credential can lift is only as strong as that credential.
