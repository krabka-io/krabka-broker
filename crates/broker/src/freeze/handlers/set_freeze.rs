//! `SetTopicFreeze`, api key 1015.
//!
//! One request freezes a scope, or removes the freeze on one. A scope is a
//! literal topic name or a topic-name prefix, and `pattern_type` says which.
//! The controller writes the outcome to the metadata log, so a freeze holds
//! after a restart and after a leader change.
//!
//! Authorization: `Alter` on `Cluster("kafka-cluster")`. On a deny the
//! response carries `CLUSTER_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED` (31).
//!
//! # A freeze takes one command, and a thaw takes two people
//!
//! A freeze needs no break-glass proposal. An operator must reach it in one
//! command during an incident, on a cluster where nobody installed key material
//! yet, and freezing is the safe direction.
//!
//! A thaw needs an approved proposal, and it needs a signature whatever
//! `freeze.require_signature` says. That asymmetry is the feature. Without it a
//! freeze is only as strong as the one credential that set it, which is the
//! credential an attacker already holds when the incident is a compromise.
//!
//! # The consume and the thaw commit together
//!
//! A thaw prepends the consumed proposal record to its own record and submits
//! one `submit_change` call. That single raft append is what stops one approval
//! from authorizing two thaws across a crash.
//!
//! # The timestamp
//!
//! A signed record keeps the `set_at_ms` that the operator signed, because the
//! broker checks that value against the skew window and against the entry it
//! replaces. An unsigned record takes this broker's clock instead. An unsigned
//! freeze is the broker's attestation rather than the operator's proof, so the
//! broker's clock is the honest stamp, and a client then cannot park an entry
//! in the far future where no later record replaces it.
