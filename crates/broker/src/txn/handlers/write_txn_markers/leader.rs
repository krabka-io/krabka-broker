//! A transaction marker that the leader of its partition appends with
//! `requiredAcks=-1`, and the wait for the marker to commit.
//!
//! Kafka's `KafkaApis.handleWriteTxnMarkersRequest` appends the markers
//! through `ReplicaManager.appendRecords` with `requiredAcks=-1` and the
//! broker's `request.timeout.ms`. It answers a partition only when its
//! `DelayedProduce` completes, that is when the high watermark covers the
//! marker. The transaction coordinator writes `CompleteCommit` or
//! `CompleteAbort` only after every partition answered `NONE`.
//!
//! A marker that a leader answered at its local append can die with that
//! leader before a follower fetched it. The coordinator then records the
//! transaction complete, and the next leader of the partition holds the
//! transaction open permanently. The last stable offset of the partition
//! stops at the first record of the transaction, and a `read_committed`
//! consumer reads nothing after it.
