//! `TxnOffsetCommit` (`api_key=28`). The consumer side of the
//! consume-process-produce pattern. A transactional producer that also
//! reads commits its consumed offsets atomically with its transaction by
//! appending them to `__consumer_offsets` with `is_transactional=true` +
//! the producer's (pid, epoch). The offsets are held under the partition's
//! LSO until a `WriteTxnMarkers` commit or abort marker arrives.
//!
//! Versions 0 to 2 are non-flexible and carry no `generation_id` or
//! `member_id` field. Versions 3 to 5 are flexible, carry tagged fields, and
//! add `generation_id`, `member_id`, and `group_instance_id`. Version 6
//! (KIP-1319, Kafka trunk; 4.3.1 stops at 5) names each topic by `TopicId`
//! instead of `Name`, in the request and in the response. An id the image
//! does not hold, or the zero id, answers `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_ID (100)` on every
//! row of that topic before the topic `Read` gate, and an id it holds is
//! authorized and checked for existence under the topic's name. The committed
//! offset records the topic's id from v6 on, and at every version under
//! `unstable.api.versions.enable`, as Kafka trunk's `KafkaApis` hands it to the
//! coordinator. Kafka 4.3.1 records the zero id for the versions it has, 0 to
//! 5. v6 also answers a missing group `GROUP_ID_NOT_FOUND` and a refused member
//! epoch `STALE_MEMBER_EPOCH`, which older versions answer `ILLEGAL_GENERATION`.
//!
//! On v3 and above, the shared `validate_commit` validates the
//! consumer-group metadata against the classic generation or the KIP-848
//! next-gen member epoch. KIP-447 requires fencing that is "consistent with
//! normal offset fencing".
//!
//! ## ACL preamble
//!
//! Three gates run in order:
//! * `Write` on `TransactionalId(transactional_id)`. A deny gives the whole
//!   response `TRANSACTIONAL_ID_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (53)`.
//! * `Read` on `Group(group_id)`. A deny gives the whole response
//!   `GROUP_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (30)`.
//! * `Read` on `Topic(name)` for each topic. A deny gives every partition row
//!   of that topic `TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (29)`.
//!
//! ## Existence check
//!
//! After the topic `Read` gate, every partition of an authorized topic goes
//! through the same existence check Kafka runs in
//! `KafkaApis.handleTxnOffsetCommitRequest` (lines 2124-2150): a topic the
//! metadata image does not hold, or a partition index outside that topic's
//! range, answers `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION (3)` on that row and is left
//! out of the transactional append. This code survives a later group-fencing
//! failure too: the fenced-request response still carries
//! `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION` on these rows rather than the fencing error.
//! See [`existence::unknown_partitions`].
//!
//! ## After the topic sweep
//!
//! The denied and unknown rows keep their own codes on every later exit, as
//! Kafka merges the group coordinator's answer into a response builder that
//! already holds them (`KafkaApis.scala:2185`). The response lists the
//! sweep's rows first, as that builder does; see [`response::build_response`].
//! When no row survives the sweep, the handler answers those rows and stops,
//! as Kafka does not call `commitTransactionalOffsets` then
//! (`KafkaApis.scala:2163-2165`): no routing check, no fencing code, no
//! transaction registration. Otherwise the group
//! routing check runs first, so a client on the wrong broker gets the
//! retriable `NOT_COORDINATOR` and a shard still replaying answers
//! `COORDINATOR_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS`, then the staged producer identity gate, then
//! the producer's verification with the transaction coordinator (KIP-890, see
//! [`verification`]), then the KIP-447 fencing checks.
