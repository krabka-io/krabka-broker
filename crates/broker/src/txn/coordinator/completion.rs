//! Completion of transactions whose `Prepare*` record is durable.
//!
//! Kafka's coordinator answers `EndTxn` with `NONE` as soon as the
//! `PrepareCommit` or `PrepareAbort` record is in the transaction log. Its
//! `TransactionMarkerChannelManager` then writes the markers and the
//! `Complete*` record, and it retries until that work is done or the
//! coordinator loses the partition. `TransactionStateManager` hands every
//! `Prepare*` transaction it loads to the same channel.
//!
//! This module is that channel. `EndTxn` completes a transaction inline when
//! it can. When the broker stops between the two appends, or the marker
//! fan-out or the `Complete*` append fails, the transaction stays in
//! `Prepare*`. Recovery and the failed request queue the transactional id
//! here, and [`crate::txn::completion`] retries it until it completes.
