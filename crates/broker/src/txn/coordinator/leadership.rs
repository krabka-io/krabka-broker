//! Which `__transaction_state` partitions this broker leads, and the load
//! status of each one.
//!
//! Kafka's `TransactionCoordinator.onElection` loads a state partition when
//! the broker becomes its leader, and `onResignation` unloads it when the
//! broker stops leading it. While a partition loads,
//! `TransactionStateManager.getAndMaybeAddTransactionState` answers
//! `COORDINATOR_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS`, and it answers `NOT_COORDINATOR` for a
//! partition that has no cache entry.
//!
//! Many tasks apply the leadership from the metadata image that each one read:
//! the reconcile loop, every transaction handler, the completion task and the
//! expiry sweeps. A task can apply its image after another task has applied a
//! newer one. Kafka orders elections and resignations by the coordinator
//! epoch, which is the partition leader epoch
//! (`removeLoadingPartitionWithEpoch`). This module does the same: an image
//! changes a partition only when its leader epoch is higher than the epoch
//! that the coordinator already holds. Leader epochs restart when the topic is
//! deleted and created again, so each value also records the topic id.
