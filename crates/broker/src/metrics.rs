//! Broker-side Prometheus metrics.
//!
//! Mirrors the operator's `telemetry` / `health` pattern: a shared
//! `Registry` is wrapped in `Arc<Mutex<…>>` so hot-path counters can
//! be looked up without holding the registry lock. The
//! [`BrokerMetrics`] struct hands out cheap `Arc<Counter>` / `Arc<Gauge>`
//! handles that handlers and background tasks clone and increment
//! directly.
//!
//! Naming follows Prometheus convention: `krabka_broker_<subject>_<unit>`.
//! Where Kafka has a canonical JMX name, we keep the metric semantics
//! close to it (e.g. `BrokerTopicMetrics:BytesInPerSec` ↔
//! `krabka_broker_topic_bytes_in_total`), but the units convert from
//! per-second gauges to monotonic counters per Prometheus best practice
//! — operators compute rates with `rate()` at scrape time.
