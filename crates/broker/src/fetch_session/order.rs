//! The eviction index of the session cache: Kafka's `FetchSessionCacheShard`
//! bookkeeping, `lastUsed`, `evictableByAll` and `evictableByPrivileged`, and
//! its `tryEvict` decision (KIP-227).
//!
//! A full cache does not hand a newcomer the least recently used session. A
//! session is displaced only when it is stale, or when the newcomer is worth
//! more than the cheapest session that may be displaced:
//!
//! 1. The session unused the longest goes when it has been unused for more than
//!    [`MIN_EVICTION`], whoever asks.
//! 2. Otherwise the newcomer takes the first entry of the class it may
//!    displace, and only when its own [`EvictableKey`] does not order below that
//!    entry's: a privileged newcomer (a follower fetch, `replica_id >= 0`) may
//!    take the smallest consumer session outright, or the smallest follower
//!    session that is older than [`MIN_EVICTION`] and holds fewer partitions;
//!    a consumer newcomer may take only a consumer session older than
//!    [`MIN_EVICTION`] that holds fewer partitions.
//!
//! Anything else refuses the allocation, and the caller answers sessionless,
//! which is what keeps a full broker from churning healthy sessions: each
//! displaced consumer would reconnect with a full fetch and displace another.
//!
//! The three indexes are ordered sets, so a lookup is O(log n) in the number
//! of sessions and reads the first entry of one of them, not a scan of the
//! session map with the cache mutex held. Time is a [`Duration`] elapsed since
//! the cache's own [`MonotonicClock`](qubit_clock::MonotonicClock) origin.
//! Every stamp in one cache reads that one clock, so they compare as a total
//! order, and a test drives the order with a
//! [`qubit_clock::ManualMonotonicClock`] instead of a sleep.
