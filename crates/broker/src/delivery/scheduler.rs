//! The broker-wide deliver-at-time scheduler.
//!
//! One task per broker, not one per partition. It holds a min-heap of the next
//! activation deadline of every scheduled partition this broker leads, sleeps
//! until the earliest of them, advances the partitions that came due, and
//! re-arms.
//!
//! The task exists for liveness only. A fetch recomputes the watermark under
//! the log mutex, so a consumer that keeps polling sees every batch on time
//! whatever this task does. What the task adds is the wake for a consumer that
//! is *parked* in a long poll with no fetch in flight to do that recompute.
//! See the [module documentation](crate::delivery).
//!
//! A partition whose next batch is not due yet costs nothing on a sweep: its
//! deadline sits in the heap and the loop skips it. A partition with nothing
//! waiting is advanced on every sweep, which is one uncontended mutex and no
//! I/O. A partition whose topic delivers immediately leaves the heap on the
//! sweep that finds it and reports no metric series.
