//! The re-arm handle of the broker-wide delivery scheduler.
//!
//! The scheduler sleeps until the earliest activation deadline it knows about.
//! A produce can land a batch that comes due before that instant, and the task
//! would then wake too late. It publishes the instant it sleeps on here, and the
//! partition writer compares each new deadline against that instant. Only a
//! sooner deadline wakes the task, so an ordinary append pays one atomic load.
//!
//! A missed wake costs promptness and never correctness. A fetch recomputes the
//! watermark under the log mutex, so it never serves a batch early and never
//! holds one back once its deadline has passed.
