//! In-memory share-partition acquisition state machine (KIP-932).
//!
//! This is the pure core that the share-partition leader drives. It owns no
//! I/O. It tracks the per-offset delivery state over the live window
//! `[start_offset, end_offset)`, that is SPSO to SPEO, as a list of contiguous
//! `InFlightBatch` runs. It answers `acquire`, `acknowledge`, and
//! `expire_locks` queries. Bytes, logs, locks, and persistence live elsewhere.
//!
//! Delivery-state codes match Kafka's on-the-wire values: `DS_AVAILABLE=0`,
//! `DS_ACQUIRED=1`, `DS_ACKNOWLEDGED=2`, `DS_ARCHIVING=3` and
//! `DS_ARCHIVED=4`. `Acquired` is transient, and the machine persists it back
//! as `Available(0)`. `Deferred` is KFC-1's refinement of `Available` and
//! persists as `Available(0)` too, so scheduled delivery adds no code to the
//! wire encoding. `Archiving` is KIP-1191's first phase of the dead-letter
//! queue: a record that a `Reject` or the delivery limit would archive waits
//! there, not terminal, until its dead-letter record is written.
//!
//! This file holds the types and the constructor. The transitions sit in one
//! module per concern: `acquire` grows the window and hands records out,
//! `acknowledge` applies a consumer's verdict, `locks` runs the acquisition
//! lock lifetime, `deferral` implements KFC-1 scheduled delivery, `window`
//! keeps the run list in shape, and `persistence` maps to and from the share
//! coordinator's records.
