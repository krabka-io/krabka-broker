//! The produce requests of one destination, coalesced: Kafka's
//! `ShareGroupDLQStateManager.SendThread` and `coalesceProduceRequests`.
//!
//! Every range that is dead-lettered has rounds of records to produce, and
//! each round is a batch for one partition of the dead-letter topic. A round
//! waits in the queue of the broker that leads its partition. While a request
//! is in flight to a broker, the rounds that arrive for it pile up, and when
//! the request completes they go out together: one produce request holds the
//! rounds of every range and every partition that the broker leads, however
//! many ranges they came from. The rounds for one partition become one batch,
//! because a produce request takes one batch for a partition.
//!
//! A request holds as many rounds as the topic's `max.message.bytes` lets one
//! batch hold. A round that would take the batch of its partition past the limit
//! waits for the next request, and the first round for a partition is always
//! taken, so a round that is over the limit by itself still goes out, and the
//! broker reports the limit. Each round is answered with the response to the
//! request that carried it, and the round reads its own partition's row, so a
//! range learns of its own records and no other's.
