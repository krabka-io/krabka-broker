//! The dead-letter write: Kafka's `ShareGroupDLQStateManager`.
//!
//! [`DlqWriter`] validates the group's topic, creates it when the cluster
//! allows and it is missing, and produces the dead-letter records to the
//! leader of the partition that the source partition maps to. Kafka sends
//! both requests through an inter-broker `NetworkClient`, to a random broker
//! for the topic creation and to the partition leader for the produce, and
//! the leader authorizes and appends like any other produce. This does the
//! same over the inter-broker listener, so the append takes the ordinary
//! produce path with its checks, its throttles and its replication.
//!
//! Each request retries as Kafka's does: up to 5 attempts, backing off from
//! 1 s to 30 s. A write that runs out of attempts, or that a broker refuses
//! for good, fails, and the leader manager archives the records regardless.
//!
//! The produce requests to one leader share one connection, opened when the
//! first needs it and kept for the ones after it, as Kafka's send thread keeps
//! one `NetworkClient` for every dead-letter produce. A write that pays for a
//! TCP, TLS and SASL setup each time would turn a consumer that rejects at a
//! high rate into a storm of connections.
//!
//! The rounds of every write for one leader are coalesced, as Kafka's send
//! thread coalesces its handlers ([`super::coalesce`]): while a request is in
//! flight to a leader, the rounds that arrive for it wait, and go out in as
//! few requests as `max.message.bytes` allows. A round is answered with the
//! response to the request that carried it, so a write ends when its own
//! records are written, and it retries on its own.
//!
//! Each round counts on the `DeadLetterQueue*` meters of Kafka's
//! `ShareGroupMetrics`: an attempt to produce it, the records of a round that
//! is written, and a write that fails.
