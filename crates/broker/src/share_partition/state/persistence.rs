//! The bridge between the live window and the share coordinator's records.
//!
//! This module holds the projection of the in-flight batch list into
//! `StateBatch` values that the share coordinator writes, and the reload that
//! rebuilds the machine from them. It also holds the two counters a caller
//! reads out of the machine, `delivery_complete_count` and
//! `count_acquired_batches`. Both directions of the mapping are stated once,
//! here, so a change to the persisted delivery-state codes touches one file.
