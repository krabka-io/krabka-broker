//! Terminal disposition of an acquired offset range.
//!
//! This module holds `acknowledge`, the step where a share consumer reports
//! what it did with the records it holds. `Accept` completes them, `Release`
//! puts them back for redelivery, and `Reject` and `Gap` archive them. It is
//! separate from acquisition because it is the only place that moves a record
//! into a terminal state on a consumer's word, and so the only place the
//! delivery-complete accounting grows outside an internal archive.

    /// A range below the SPSO is already done, and a range that starts below
    /// it is cut there, as `ack_bounds` says. `member`
    /// must currently hold the rest of the range as `Acquired`. The method
    /// splits the range into its own batches at the boundaries, then applies
    /// the acknowledgement. `Accept` gives Acknowledged. `Release` gives
    /// Available, clears the lock and the owner, and keeps `delivery_count`
    /// for redelivery, unless the count has reached `max_attempts`: then the
    /// records are archived at once, as Kafka's `InFlightState.tryUpdateState`
    /// does. `Reject` and `Gap` give Archived. With a dead-letter queue
    /// ([`AcquisitionState::set_dlq_enabled`]), a `Reject` and a `Release` at
    /// the limit give `Archiving` instead. The method then advances the
    /// SPSO over any new terminal prefix and marks the state dirty.

    /// `INVALID_REQUEST` for a range past the records ever handed out, and
