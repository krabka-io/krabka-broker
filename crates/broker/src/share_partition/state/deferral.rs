//! KFC-1 scheduled delivery: holding a record back until its delivery time.
//!
//! `Deferred` is a refinement of `Available` that acquisition steps over, so a
//! share group reaches the due records sitting behind a waiting one. This
//! module holds the only two transitions in and out of it, `defer_internal` and
//! `promote_deferred`, and the `deferred_records` count the `ShareFetch`
//! handler uses to bound materialization. The state is derived from a clock
//! reading rather than owned by the machine, which is why nothing here marks
//! the state dirty and why it persists as `Available`.
