//! Geometry of the in-flight batch list that backs the acquisition window.
//!
//! This module holds the operations that reshape the run list without deciding
//! a delivery outcome. It splits a run at an offset boundary, merges neighbours
//! that agree on state, count, and lock, advances the share-partition start
//! offset over a terminal prefix, and answers whether one member holds a whole
//! offset range. The concern-specific modules call these helpers; none of them
//! is part of the public surface of `AcquisitionState`.
