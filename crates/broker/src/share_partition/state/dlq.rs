//! KIP-1191's two phases of the dead-letter queue, as the acquisition machine
//! sees them.
//!
//! Phase 1 is a transition. When the group has a dead-letter queue
//! ([`AcquisitionState::set_dlq_enabled`]), a record that a `Reject` or the
//! delivery limit would archive goes to `Archiving` instead, and the machine
//! notes the run in `pending_dlq`. `Archiving` is not terminal, and it
//! persists as delivery state 3, so a leader that takes over after a crash
//! finds the run and writes its dead-letter record again. Kafka's
//! `InFlightState.tryUpdateState` and `SharePartition.recordStateWithDlq` make
//! the same choice.
//!
//! Phase 2 is [`AcquisitionState::finish_archiving`]. The owner writes the
//! dead-letter record for each run that [`AcquisitionState::take_pending_dlq`]
//! hands out, and then archives the run whether or not that write worked, as
//! `SharePartition.initiateDLQAndArchive` does: a record that cannot be
//! dead-lettered must not hold the SPSO for ever.
