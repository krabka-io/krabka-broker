//! The share-group dead-letter queue (KIP-1191).
//!
//! From `share.version` 2, a record that a share consumer rejects, or that
//! uses up the group's delivery count limit, can be written to a dead-letter
//! topic before the share partition archives it. The group opts in with
//! `errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name`. This module is what Kafka's
//! `ShareGroupDLQManager` and `ShareGroupDLQStateManager` do: it validates
//! the topic, creates it when the cluster allows, and produces one record for
//! each dead-lettered offset.
//!
//! The acquisition machine decides which records go ([`super::state`]), and
//! the leader manager runs the two phases around the write
//! ([`super::manager`]). This module owns the write:
//!
//! - `validate` checks the group's topic against the cluster's rules;
//! - `record` builds the dead-letter records;
//! - `source` reads the source records for a group that copies them;
//! - `coalesce` puts the rounds of every write for one destination into as few
//!   produce requests as `max.message.bytes` allows;
//! - `writer` sends the topic creation and the produce request, retries, and
//!   counts the `DeadLetterQueue*` meters.
//!
//! Whether a write succeeds does not decide the record's fate. Kafka archives
//! the record whatever [`DlqSink::write`] answers, and logs a failure.
