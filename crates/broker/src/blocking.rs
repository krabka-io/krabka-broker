//! Where the broker runs blocking work.
//!
//! The file IO of the log, the replay of an internal topic, and the calls into
//! the synchronous remote-storage SPIs all hold a thread for a while, and must
//! not stall the async poller. A native runtime takes them off it: a
//! multi-thread runtime runs them in place with
//! [`tokio::task::block_in_place`], which hands the worker's other tasks to
//! another thread, and a current-thread runtime runs them on tokio's blocking
//! pool, because `block_in_place` panics there.
//!
//! `wasm32-wasip1` has no threads. Tokio's blocking pool panics there with
//! "OS can't spawn worker thread", and the only runtime is current-thread. So
//! on that target the work runs inline on the runtime thread, and every other
//! task waits for the length of one call.
//!
//! [`run_blocking`], [`run_blocking_catching`] and [`spawn_blocking`] are the
//! three shapes the broker uses; nothing else in the crate calls
//! `block_in_place` or `spawn_blocking` on a runtime path. A test makes a
//! native thread run its blocking work inline too, with
//! [`inline_blocking_on_this_thread`], and so drives the WASI path on every
//! target.
