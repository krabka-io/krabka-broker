//! The remote-tier reads that answer with the log's own bytes: a share fetch
//! (KIP-932) and a dead-letter copy (KIP-1191) of an offset that only the
//! remote tier holds (KIP-405).
//!
//! Kafka serves both through `ReplicaManager`'s remote read. A share fetch
//! goes through `DelayedShareFetch`, which hands the partition to
//! `RemoteLogManager.asyncRead` when the share-partition start offset is
//! below the local log start. A dead-letter copy goes through
//! `ShareGroupDLQRecordFetcher`, whose `LogReader.readAsync` reads remote data
//! the same way. Both take one task of the remote reader pool, so both take
//! one permit of [`super::ReaderPool`] here.
