//! The bounded reader pool that fronts every cold-tier read.
//!
//! Kafka gives `RemoteLogManager` a `remoteStorageReaderThreadPool` of
//! `remote.log.reader.threads` threads (10 by default) behind a queue of
//! `remote.log.reader.max.pending.tasks` (100 by default). When the queue is
//! full the executor throws `RejectedExecutionException` and
//! `ReplicaManager.processRemoteFetches` answers that partition with an error
//! instead of parking the fetch. That cap is what keeps a burst of cold-tier
//! consumers from consuming the resources local produce and fetch depend on.
//!
//! krabka's remote SPI calls run on the tokio blocking pool, which the WAL
//! fsync, the local fetch and the replica IO share, so the same cap is needed
//! here for the same reason. [`ReaderPool`] is that cap: a
//! [`Semaphore`](tokio::sync::Semaphore) of `threads` permits, plus a count of
//! the readers waiting for one. A read that would push the waiting count past
//! `max_pending_tasks` is rejected rather than queued.
