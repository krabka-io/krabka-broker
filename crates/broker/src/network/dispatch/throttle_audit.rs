//! KIP-219 throttle-echo audit.
//!
//! [`super::response::throttle_is_leading_field`] decides whether the dispatch
//! loop may report a request-quota delay by patching the first int32 of an
//! already-encoded response body. Getting that table wrong is silent in both
//! directions: an API missing from it answers `throttle_time_ms = 0` while the
//! broker holds the response, so a client never backs off and the quota
//! degrades into latency injection; an API wrongly in it has four bytes of
//! some other field overwritten.
//!
//! This module pins the table against the generated encoders. For every
//! `(api_key, version)` pair [`crate::api_catalog::dispatched_apis`] serves
//! it encodes that API's response with a sentinel in `throttle_time_ms` and
//! looks at where the sentinel lands, which is the byte layout the pinned
//! `krabka-protocol` response schemas produce rather than a restatement of the
//! table under test. An API added to the catalog but not to [`probes`] fails
//! [`every_advertised_api_is_classified`].
