// `dst.extend_from_slice(&data[..])` into the codec's write buffer. Removing
// both copies means swapping the codec for a custom `Encoder<impl Buf>` that
// vectored-writes header and body, which reaches `codec.rs`, the roundtrip
// test, and every signature that names `Framed<S, LengthDelimitedCodec>`.
//
// `benches/perf_deferrals.rs` prices that chained-`Buf` prototype against this
// path. Both sides write to a sink that keeps no bytes, so the socket write is
// out of the comparison on both and the reported saving is an upper bound:
//

//     1 KiB     57 ns      32 ns     25 ns   (43%)

//     1 MiB     31 us      32 ns     31 us   (99.9%)
//
// Measured by the `bench` job of the `ci` workflow, which runs this suite on
// the nightly schedule and prints the same table into its job summary; the
// samples behind it are the run's `criterion-baseline` artifact. For the
// current numbers read the latest scheduled `ci` run in the repository's
// Actions tab rather than this table, which records the decision and not a
// particular machine.
//
// Keep. The saving is proportional to the body, and the one API whose bodies
// are unbounded does not come through here: Fetch is written by
// `network::fetch_writer`, which already skips both copies (its module doc has
// the same motivation). What is left on this path is produce, metadata and
// admin responses on the order of a kilobyte, where the whole framing step
// costs under 100 ns against a request that takes tens of microseconds to
// serve. Note the old price estimate of "~50 `framed.send` call sites" is
// stale — the dispatch tree has since funnelled its responses through three —
// but a custom codec is still the wrong trade for ~25 ns a response. Revisit
// only if a non-Fetch response becomes both large and hot; a Metadata response
// for a very large cluster is the plausible candidate, and clients refresh it
// on the order of minutes.

/// * No `ThrottleTimeMs` field at any version: `SaslHandshake` (17),

///   the share-coordinator state RPCs (83-87) and `GetReplicaLogInfo` (93).
