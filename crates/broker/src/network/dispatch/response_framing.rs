//! Benchmark seam over the generic response-framing path.
//!
//! Two functions make up that path: [`super::response::encode_response`],
//! which copies a handler's body to prepend the 4- or 5-byte response header,
//! and the [`KafkaCodec`] the connection loop wraps its stream in, whose
//! `Encoder<Bytes>` copies that body a second time into the codec's write
//! buffer. The PERF note on `encode_response` weighs replacing the pair
//! with a chained `Buf` and a vectored write; `benches/perf_deferrals.rs` is
//! what put the measured saving into that note.
//!
//! Both functions here are the production ones. The seam exists only because
//! they are crate-internal and a benchmark is an external crate.
