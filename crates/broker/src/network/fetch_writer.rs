//! Zero-copy fetch response writer (Increments C + D).
//!
//! The generic dispatch loop writes every response with
//! `Framed<S, LengthDelimitedCodec>::send`, which copies the whole body into
//! the codec's write buffer. `encode_response` already copied that body once
//! to prepend the correlation header. For a 100 KB+ fetch that is hundreds of
//! KB of avoidable `memcpy` per request.
//!
//! This module replaces that path **for Fetch responses only** with an ordered
//! [`WriteOp`] plan:
//!
//! * **Increment C (portable, TLS-safe):** the writer writes the response
//!   header and the envelope metadata inline from userspace, and hands each
//!   partition's records region to the socket as its own segment with a
//!   vectored `write_all`. It does not copy the records bytes through the
//!   codec.
//! * **Increment D (Linux plaintext only):** for large records runs on a
//!   plaintext `TcpStream`, the records region becomes a [`WriteOp::File`]
//!   backed by the segment `.log` fd. The kernel `sendfile(2)` zero-copy path
//!   drains it from the page cache to the NIC and never through userspace. On
//!   TLS, on non-Linux, and for small runs, the writer falls back to the
//!   vectored/`pread` path of Increment C. The wire bytes are identical.
//!
//! ## Framing
//!
//! Kafka frames every response with a 4-byte big-endian length prefix. The
//! length is **not** part of any records or file bytes, so the writer computes
//! it up front from the exact body length (`correlation header + Σ op
//! lengths`) and writes it from userspace before it drains the ops. The writer
//! knows the exact body length without materializing the body: the records and
//! file ops carry their own length, and the inline ops are already-built
//! `Bytes`.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! The plan for the response body comes from the `body_plan` child, which
//! encodes the metadata and leaves each records field as its own op. The
//! `resolve` child turns one such records op into the segments the writer
//! emits, `sink` decides what a given stream can take, and `drain` writes the
//! finished plan out with `sendfile` for the file-backed ops.
