//! Replica placement for a stretch cluster. A "site" is the `broker.rack`
//! value of a broker, so two brokers with the same rack are in the same site.
//!
//! The placement gives two properties:
//!
//! - **Site spread.** The replicas of one partition go in different sites. The
//!   loss of a full site then costs one replica, and a producer with
//!   `acks=all` and `min.insync.replicas=2` continues to commit.
//! - **Leadership pinning.** In Kafka, `replicas[0]` *is* the preferred leader
//!   of the partition. The order of the replica list is thus the full
//!   mechanism that pins leadership to a site. This module puts a broker of
//!   the preferred site first. The KIP-460 auto-rebalance in
//!   [`crate::leader_rebalance`] and `kafka-leader-election --election-type
//!   preferred` then keep the leader there. A leader in the site of the
//!   producers removes one inter-site trip from the write path.
//!
//! A witness is a data-bearing node in a third, cheap site. It replicates the
//! partition data and it votes in `KRaft`, but it does not serve clients. Thus
//! a witness is a replica, but it is never `replicas[0]`.
//!
//! The module is pure. It does no I/O and it reads no clock. It sorts the
//! brokers by node id and never iterates a hash container, so the only source
//! of variation is the [`PlacementRng`] that the caller hands in. Like Kafka's
//! `StripedReplicaPlacer`, the placement starts at a random site and at a
//! random broker inside each site, and it advances by one per partition. A
//! fixed seed makes the placement reproducible, and the tests rely on that.
//!
//! A fenced broker is a last resort, as in `StripedReplicaPlacer`: a site
//! offers its unfenced brokers first, no fenced broker leads a partition, and
//! the placement refuses only when the replication factor exceeds the number
//! of brokers it got, fenced ones included, or when none of them is unfenced.
//!
//! Like the WAL voter placement in `crate::wal::quorum::placement`, this code
//! fails closed. When it cannot satisfy the site guarantee, it returns an
//! empty outer vec, and the caller reports `INVALID_REPLICATION_FACTOR`.
