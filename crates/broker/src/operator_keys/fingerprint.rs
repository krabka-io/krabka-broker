/// The approver set comes from each broker's own `broker.toml`, so two brokers
/// can legitimately disagree during a rolling config change. Every break-glass
/// audit event records this fingerprint, which makes the disagreement visible
/// after the fact.
///
/// The input is sorted and de-duplicated first, and each name is
/// length-prefixed, so the fingerprint depends on the members alone: not on the
/// order an operator wrote them in, and not on where one name ends and the next
/// begins.
