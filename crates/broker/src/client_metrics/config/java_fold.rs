//! Java's case folding, for [`java_to_fancy`](super::java_to_fancy).
//!
//! Java's `CASE_INSENSITIVE` (`(?i)`) folds ASCII case only. It folds Unicode
//! case as well when `UNICODE_CASE` (`(?u)`) is on, and `(?U)`
//! (`UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS`) turns that on. `fancy_regex` has one `i` flag.
//! It folds Unicode case with the simple case folding tables, and it folds a
//! whole class or a whole reference at once, with no switch for one member:
//! `(?i)service-` matches `ſervice-` (long s) there, and not in Java, and
//! `(?iu)[\w]` matches U+017F, which Java's `\w` does not. The inline `(?-u)`
//! cannot switch the fold off (`ChangingUnicodeModeUnsupported`), and
//! `RegexBuilder::unicode_mode(false)` is a switch for the whole pattern that
//! also refuses `.`, `\W` and `\p{..}`.
//!
//! So the rewrite never turns `fancy_regex`'s `i` on, except for a
//! backreference. While an `i` is in force it writes the folding out.
//!
//! - Without `u`, an ASCII letter is both its cases, `[aA]`, or `aA` in a
//!   character class, and a class range is the range plus the ranges of the
//!   other case of the letters it covers, which is what Java's `CIRange`
//!   matches. A non-ASCII character is as it is.
//! - With `u`, a letter, a class member and a class range are the sets of code
//!   points that Java's `single`, `BitClass` and `CIRangeU` accept. Those
//!   compare `Character.toLowerCase(Character.toUpperCase(ch))`, which is not
//!   the simple case folding of `fancy_regex`: `İ` (U+0130) and `ı` (U+0131)
//!   match `i` in Java, and a range that has `K` and not `k` does not match
//!   the Kelvin sign (U+212A). [`java_case`](super::java_case) computes the
//!   sets, and the class that holds them is case sensitive.
//!
//! The escapes that name a letter, `\x41`, `\x{41}`, `\uhhhh`, `\0101` and the
//! text of `\Q...\E`, fold as the letter does. Java also widens the properties
//! for a case under `(?i)`: `\p{Lower}` and `\p{Upper}` are the ASCII letters
//! of both cases, and `\p{Lu}`, `\p{Ll}` and `\p{Lt}` are all cased letters.
//! [`property_class`] writes those. Java does not fold `\w`, `\d`, `\s`, or any
//! other property or POSIX class, and with `i` off neither does the rewrite.
//! The POSIX classes are ASCII in Java without `(?U)`, and the Unicode
//! properties with it, where `fancy_regex` reads them as Unicode always.
//!
//! `\Q...\E` is gone before any of that is read. Java's `RemoveQEQuoting`
//! rewrites the text of each one into escaped characters before it parses the
//! pattern, so `[\Qa\E-c]` is the range `[a-c]`, and [`remove_qe_quoting`] does
//! the same.
//!
//! A run of literals is one slice in Java and a lone literal is `single`, and
//! they differ for `ß`: `(?iu)ß` matches `ß` only, and `(?iu)ßß` matches `ẞ`
//! (U+1E9E) too. [`Translator`](super::Translator) tells the two apart, as Java's
//! `atom` does, by the literal chars up to the next token that is not one, less
//! the last of them when a quantifier follows.
//!
//! One thing is left different, because `fancy_regex` has no other way to
//! compare the text of a group. A backreference under a fold is written
//! `(?i:\1)`, and it compares the text it refers to with the text at hand
//! differently from Java's `CIBackRef`:
//!
//! - Under `(?i)` Java compares ASCII case only, and `fancy_regex`'s `i`
//!   compares two texts Unicode-insensitively, unless both are ASCII. The two
//!   agree on every ASCII text. They differ when the group holds a non-ASCII
//!   letter, and the reference matches the same letter in the other case:
//!   `(?i)(é)\1` matches `éÉ` in `fancy_regex`, and not in Java.
//! - Under `(?iu)` Java compares `Character.toLowerCase` of
//!   `Character.toUpperCase`, and `fancy_regex` compares simple case foldings
//!   of two texts that are as long in bytes. They differ for `İ` and `ı`, which
//!   Java's key makes `i`: `(?iu)(i)\1` matches `iİ` in Java, and not in
//!   `fancy_regex`. They differ for a letter and a case that take another number
//!   of bytes, such as `s` and `ſ`, `k` and the Kelvin sign, `ß` and `ẞ`, and `å`
//!   and the angstrom sign: `(?iu)(s)\1` matches `sſ` in Java, and not in
//!   `fancy_regex`. They agree on the other letters.
