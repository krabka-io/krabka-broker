//! Java's Unicode case rules for `(?iu)`, as explicit sets of code points.
//!
//! `fancy_regex` folds Unicode case with the simple case folding of its `i`
//! flag, and it applies that fold to a whole class or a whole reference. Java
//! compares a different relation: `CASE_INSENSITIVE` with `UNICODE_CASE` makes
//! a character `ch` match a pattern character when `Character.toLowerCase` of
//! `Character.toUpperCase` of the two agree. The relations differ for a few
//! letters, and a class has no way to leave a member out of the fold. So the
//! rewrite never turns `i` on. It writes the set that Java's predicate accepts
//! as code point ranges, and the class that holds them is case sensitive.
//!
//! The predicates are those of `java.util.regex.Pattern` in JDK 17:
//!
//! - `single` and `SingleU` for a character outside a class, and for a class
//!   member that is not in Latin-1.
//! - `BitClass.add` for a class member in Latin-1, except the ten characters
//!   that `bitsOrSingle` sends to `single` instead.
//! - `CIRangeU` for a range in a class.
//!
//! `\w`, `\p{Lower}` and the other classes that Java reads as ASCII are not
//! here. Java does not fold them, and with `i` off neither does the rewrite.
//!
//! The case mapping is Java's simple one, `UnicodeData.txt` without
//! `SpecialCasing.txt`. `char::to_uppercase` and `char::to_lowercase` give the
//! full mapping, so a mapping of more than one char counts as none, apart from
//! the few that have a simple mapping under a longer full one. The table is
//! Rust's version of Unicode, which is newer than the one in JDK 17, so it
//! also folds the letters that Unicode 14 and later added.
