//! KFC-9: the break-glass rule the URM applies to a recovery nobody asked for.
//!
//! The rule reads `[break_glass]` once and then answers two questions per job:
//! whether the recovery may run at all, and whether the election that followed
//! has to be recorded as a bypass. Both answers, and the audit events that
//! carry them, live here so the manager keeps only the control flow.

/// # This path has no caller to refuse
///
/// Unclean recovery can lose committed data exactly as an operator-typed
/// unclean election does -- whenever no eligible leader replica survives to be
/// elected instead -- so the two-person rule looks as if it belongs on both.
/// It cannot be here. Leader election and the broker-heartbeat path start a
/// recovery with no request, no connection, and no principal, so a refusal has
/// no recipient and an approval has nobody to ask. An operator who types an
/// unclean election can be asked for a second signature, and a controller that
/// reacts to a dead broker at 03:00 cannot.
///
/// [`BackgroundUncleanRecovery`] is the three-valued answer to that, and
/// `audit-only` is the default for the reason the split states.
/// [`BackgroundUncleanRecovery::Require`] is the fail-closed option, and it
/// costs every partition whose leader dies at 03:00 its availability, and not
/// only the ones an incident touches.
///
/// A job that carries a proposal took the operator path, where the handler
/// already spent an approved proposal. None of this applies to it.
