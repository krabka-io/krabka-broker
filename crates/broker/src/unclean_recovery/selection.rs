//! The pure winner-selection helpers of KIP-966 unclean recovery.
//!
//! These functions rank the log states reported by the surviving replicas and
//! detect a recovery that a newer leader has already superseded. They hold no
//! I/O and no controller state, so the stateright models and the unit tests
//! drive them directly.
//!
//! # The most complete log is the last resort, not the first
//!
//! "Most complete surviving log" is a guess. It is the best guess available
//! once every replica that is known to be complete is gone, but it can still
//! drop committed records: the longest surviving log is only the longest one
//! that answered. Two sets of replicas are not a guess. A replica the
//! partition record still names in its ISR holds every committed record by
//! definition, and a KIP-966 eligible leader replica left the ISR while the
//! partition still had `min.insync.replicas` members, so it holds every record
//! the partition ever acknowledged. Electing either loses nothing.
//!
//! Apache Kafka orders the three the same way, in
//! `PartitionChangeBuilder.electAnyLeader`. Its `isValidNewLeader`, read out
//! of `kafka-metadata-4.3.1.jar`, is
//!
//! ```text
//! (targetIsr.contains(id) || (targetIsr.isEmpty() && targetElr.contains(id)))
//!     && isAcceptableLeader.test(id)
//! ```
//!
//! so an unfenced ISR member is a valid new leader outright, an unfenced ELR
//! member is one for a partition whose ISR has emptied, and `electAnyLeader`
//! returns either as `ElectionResult(node, false)` -- `false` being `unclean`.
//! Only when no such replica exists does Kafka reach its unclean branch.
//! [`select_leader`] is that order, and [`ElectionBasis`] is the `unclean`
//! flag under a name that says which rule fired.
//!
//! The ISR rung is narrow here and it is not dead. A recovery starts because
//! the controller's liveness registry called every ISR member dead, and it
//! leaves the ISR in the record alone while it polls, so a member that comes
//! back before the poll lands answers it while still named in that ISR. That
//! replica is complete, and reporting its election as the most complete
//! surviving log would move the unclean-election meter, take the break-glass
//! bypass audit path, and be refused outright under `unclean.recovery.require`
//! -- three wrong answers about an election that lost nothing.
//!
//! The ordering does not depend on `unclean.recovery.strategy`. Kafka's check
//! is strategy-blind, and so is this one: a `Balanced` recovery prefers a
//! complete replica over a longer incomplete log, and so does an `Aggressive`
//! one.
//!
//! # A witness is never a candidate
//!
//! `isAcceptableLeader` is the second half of the test quoted above, and
//! krabka's version of it carries one rule Kafka has no role for. A
//! `broker.witness` node replicates the partition and counts toward
//! `min.insync.replicas`, but it serves no client and must never lead: that is
//! what the role means, and every other election path enforces it through
//! [`witness_node_ids`](crate::config_keys::witness_node_ids) -- `failover_one`
//! for both failover scans, `ElectLeaders` for the operator-typed elections. A
//! witness elected here would be installed as the partition's singleton ISR
//! and would then answer no produce and no fetch, leaving the partition as
//! unusable as the offline one recovery started from.
//!
//! [`select_leader`] therefore drops the witnesses before any rule reads the
//! responses, ISR and ELR membership included. A witness can sit in both sets
//! -- it is a full ISR member and it leaves an under-min-ISR set like any
//! other replica, so its completeness is real -- but completeness is not what
//! disqualifies it. Losing its vote can leave the fallback as the only
//! election available, and that election is then reported as the data-losing
//! one it is rather than hidden behind a leader nobody can reach.
