//! Per-(topic, partition) producer-sequence tracking. Drives the
//! idempotent-producer dedup / out-of-order / epoch-fence checks in
//! `handlers::produce`.
//!
//! This tracker is a second copy of the producer state that the partition log
//! keeps (`krabka_log::Log::recovered_producers`). The produce path reads only
//! this copy. A follower copies the transaction markers that it replicates
//! into it, but not the data batches, so the copy is complete only on a
//! leader. `Partition::install_local_leadership` replaces it with the state of
//! the log on each promotion. A reader that must also answer on a follower
//! reads the log instead: `DescribeProducers`, and the log cleaner, which
//! keeps the last record of each producer.
