//! Classification and logging of the leader's `AddRaftVoter` reply.
//!
//! The join loop never terminates on a reply — only on seeing itself in the
//! committed voter set — so this mapping from error code to `JoinOutcome` is
//! purely diagnostic. It lives apart from the loop so the code-to-outcome table
//! can be unit tested without a running broker.
