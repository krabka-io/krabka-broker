//! A single partition's runtime handle. Owned by the partition registry
//! inside `Broker`. The handle gives any task:
//!
//! - read access to the partition's [`Log`] through `Arc<Mutex<Log>>`
//! - write access through a `mpsc::Sender<WriterMessage>`. A single writer
//!   task drains the channel; see `partition_writer.rs`.
//! - a [`Notify`] that fires after every successful append. Long-poll Fetch
//!   uses it to wake when new data arrives.
//! - the partition's deliver-at-time state: a lock-free mirror of the delivery
//!   watermark and a second [`Notify`] that fires when a scheduled batch comes
//!   due. See [`crate::delivery`].
