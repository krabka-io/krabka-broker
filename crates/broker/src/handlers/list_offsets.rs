//! `ListOffsets` (`api_key=2`). The handler resolves the EARLIEST / LATEST
//! sentinels with each partition's log. For tiered topics (KIP-405),
//! EARLIEST and by-timestamp lookups consult the
//! [`RemoteLogMetadataManager`](krabka_remote_storage::RemoteLogMetadataManager).
//! Local-retention deletes some offsets locally, but they still live in the
//! remote tier, and this keeps them visible. KIP-1005's latest-tiered (`-5`)
//! and KIP-1023's earliest-pending-upload (`-6`) sentinels read the same
//! metadata asynchronously. KIP-1075 bounds that remote work by the request
//! timeout and resolves all requested partitions concurrently.
//!
//! Positive-timestamp lookups resolve against the remote tier first, because
//! it holds the oldest records. They then fall back to the local log's
//! time index (KIP-405/734). The handler resolves the `MAX_TIMESTAMP` (-3) and
//! `EARLIEST_LOCAL_TIMESTAMP` (-4) sentinels against the local log.
//!
//! KFC-1 changes one sentinel and no other: on a topic that schedules
//! delivery, LATEST reports the partition's delivery watermark instead of its
//! log end offset. See [`latest_offset`](self::local::latest_offset).
//!
//! KIP-320 fences the whole request the way Fetch does: a partition row that
//! carries a `current_leader_epoch` (v4 and up) is answered with
//! `FENCED_LEADER_EPOCH` or `UNKNOWN_LEADER_EPOCH` when that epoch is not the
//! partition's live one, so a consumer with stale metadata refreshes instead of
//! receiving an offset its next Fetch would refuse. See
//! [`resolve_partition`](self::resolve::resolve_partition).
//!
//! Every other answer is decided by one bound, Kafka's `lastFetchableOffset`:
//! the log end offset for a request that is not a client's, the high watermark
//! for a `read_uncommitted` client, and the last stable offset (KIP-98) for a
//! `read_committed` one. `Partition.fetchOffsetForTimestamp` chooses it once
//! and then uses it twice over. LATEST *is* the bound, so a `read_committed`
//! consumer that seeks to end stops in front of the records of a transaction
//! that is still open instead of stepping over them. Every sentinel that
//! resolves against record data -- `MAX_TIMESTAMP`, the two tiered sentinels,
//! and a positive timestamp -- is refused with `UNKNOWN_OFFSET` when it lands
//! at or above the bound, so no client can read an offset past its own end of
//! partition by asking for it a different way. EARLIEST and
//! `EARLIEST_LOCAL_TIMESTAMP` are the exceptions Kafka leaves unmeasured:
//! both resolve from the start of the log, which is never above the bound. See
//! [`FetchBound`](self::bound::FetchBound),
//! [`fetch_bound`](self::bound::fetch_bound) and
//! [`last_fetchable_offset`](self::bound::last_fetchable_offset).
