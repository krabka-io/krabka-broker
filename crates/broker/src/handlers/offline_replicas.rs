//! The offline-replica state that `Metadata` and `DescribeTopicPartitions`
//! share: the KIP-112 / KIP-858 `offlineReplicas` list, and the leader and ISR
//! columns that have to agree with it.
//!
//! `kafka-topics --describe --unavailable-partitions` and
//! `--under-replicated-partitions` read this list, and so does every dashboard
//! built on the `AdminClient`. Two tools that are often named here do not.
//! Cruise Control needs a broker-side JVM metrics reporter and JMX, and krabka
//! has neither, so it does not run against krabka at all. Burrow is a
//! consumer-lag monitor: it decodes `__consumer_offsets` and never asks for
//! replica state. `docs/operations/ecosystem-support.md` holds the whole list.
//! Kafka computes the offline set in
//! `KRaftMetadataCache.getOfflineReplicas`: a replica is offline when its
//! broker has no registration in the metadata image, when that broker is
//! fenced, when that broker has no endpoint on the listener the request
//! arrived on, or when the log directory that holds the replica is not among
//! the broker's online directories.
//!
//! Krabka keeps the directory half of that state in the same place Kafka does.
//! [`BrokerRegistrationRecord::log_dirs`] is the broker's *online* directory
//! set, and the controller trims a reported-offline directory out of it while
//! it runs the KIP-112 failover (see
//! [`crate::handlers::broker_heartbeat::failover`]), exactly as Kafka's
//! `ReplicationControlManager.handleDirectoriesOffline` emits a
//! `BrokerRegistrationChangeRecord` carrying the surviving directories. The
//! offline set of a broker is therefore the directories named by partition
//! assignments that its registration no longer lists.
//!
//! The fencing half is replicated too. Only the controller leader keeps a
//! heartbeat registry, so it writes what that registry decides into the
//! broker's registration (see [`crate::heartbeat::fencing`]), the way Kafka's
//! controller writes `BrokerRegistrationChangeRecord.fenced`.
//! [`unavailable_brokers`] reads it back out of the image, so a request served by a follower answers with the
//! same set as one served by the controller. `DescribeCluster` calls the same
//! helper for its `is_fenced` column, so the two answers cannot drift apart.

/// conclusion is applied here instead, once, for both APIs.

/// It is deliberately narrower than [`offline_replicas`], which also reports a

/// offline for reasons the controller *can* record, and does: it shrinks the
/// ISR and moves leadership on the same edge. Kafka passes both straight
/// through its cache, so dropping them from the reported ISR here would
/// diverge from Kafka in a state Kafka does answer, to fix one it never
/// reaches.
///
/// Why any of it matters: `kafka-topics --describe --unavailable-partitions`

/// of `kafka-tools-4.3.1.jar`, `TopicCommand$PartitionDescription` has no
/// reference to it at all, and `TopicPartitionInfo` has no field to carry it.
/// The two filters are `!hasLeader() || !liveBrokers.contains(leader.id())`
/// and `replicationFactor - isr.size() > 0`, so a partition on a dead disk is
/// invisible to both for as long as it reports a live leader and a full ISR,
/// however faithfully the third column names the disk.
///
/// The same holds for a partition the controller left without a leader. Kafka
/// writes `leader = -1` and an ISR that has lost the last leader; krabka's
/// record names a leader whatever happens, so the controller publishes the
/// last-known ELR that names it instead (see
/// [`crate::elr::state::is_leaderless`]) and this projection reads it back:
/// `Leader: none`, and the last leader is out of the ISR.
