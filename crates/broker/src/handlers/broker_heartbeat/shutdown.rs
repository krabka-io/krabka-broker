//! The records a heartbeat writes when it fences a broker, lets it shut down,
//! or moves it into controlled shutdown.
//!
//! Kafka writes the same partition changes for all three
//! (`ReplicationControlManager.handleBrokerFenced` and
//! `handleBrokerInControlledShutdown` both run
//! `generateLeaderAndIsrUpdates` with the broker to remove): the broker leaves
//! the ISR of every partition it is in, and every partition it leads elects a
//! new leader. That is what the dead-broker failover scan computes, so this
//! module asks it about the broker.
