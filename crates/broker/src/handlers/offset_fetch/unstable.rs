//! The KIP-447 `UNSTABLE_OFFSET_COMMIT` partition row.
//!
//! A `read_committed` EOS consumer sets `require_stable = true` on
//! `OffsetFetch` precisely so that it is told to wait rather than handed the
//! offset a still-open transaction is about to replace. Answering with the
//! older stable offset instead makes the consumer rewind and reprocess records
//! the transaction already committed.
//!
//! Kafka's row carries the invalid-offset sentinels and an empty — not null —
//! metadata string alongside error code 88, and the two response shapes
//! (pre-KIP-516 `Partition`, KIP-516 `Partitions`) must agree on it, so both
//! are built here.
