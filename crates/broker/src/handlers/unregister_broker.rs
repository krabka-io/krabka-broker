//! `UnregisterBroker` (`api_key=64`).
//!
//! This is the admin RPC an operator uses to drop a permanently dead broker
//! from the cluster's metadata image. Once the change lands through Raft,
//! `Metadata` responses no longer advertise the broker's endpoints, and
//! clients stop routing to it.
//!
//! ## ACL
//!
//! The handler needs `Alter` on `Cluster("kafka-cluster")`. On Deny, the whole
//! response carries `error_code = CLUSTER_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (31)`.
//!
//! ## Idempotency
//!
//! A `broker_id` with no registration, a negative one included, returns
//! `BROKER_ID_NOT_REGISTERED (102)` with the message "Broker ID {id} is not
//! currently registered", as Kafka's
//! `ReplicationControlManager.unregisterBroker` does.
//!
//! ## KFC-9: dropping a broker needs two people
//!
//! Unregistering a broker is one of the transitions the break-glass two-person
//! rule gates. KIP-631 defines the request and it gains no field for this: an
//! operator gets an approval out of band through `krabka-guard`, targeted at
//! the broker id, and then runs the ordinary tool. A request that no approved
//! proposal covers answers `POLICY_VIOLATION (44)` at the top level, which is
//! where this response carries every other whole-request refusal.
//!
//! The consumed proposal rides the same `submit_change` call as the unregister
//! record, so the approval and the transition it authorized commit together.
//! The gate is active only when `[break_glass]` names an approver set.
//!
//! ## Leaving the ISRs first
//!
//! Kafka's `ReplicationControlManager.unregisterBroker` does not only drop the
//! registration. `handleBrokerUnregistered` first removes the broker from every
//! ISR it is in and elects new leaders for the partitions it leads, and writes
//! the `UnregisterBrokerRecord` after them, all in one record list. The same
//! `submit_change` here carries those partition changes ahead of the unregister
//! record, so no partition names an unregistered broker as its leader while the
//! liveness ticker waits for a heartbeat timeout.
//!
//! ## Only the active controller runs it
//!
//! Kafka forwards `UnregisterBroker` from a broker listener to the active
//! controller (`KafkaApis.forwardToController`), and
//! `ReplicationControlManager.unregisterBroker` runs there as one atomic record
//! list. The partition records above are built from the image of the node that
//! runs the handler, and a follower's or an observer's image can trail the
//! leader's. The leader applies a partition record as written, so a record built
//! from a trailing image would roll back a leader, epoch and ISR that the
//! leader committed since. A broker listener therefore forwards the request in
//! an `Envelope` to the active controller, and a request that reaches any other
//! node on the controller listener answers `NOT_CONTROLLER (41)`. The two-person
//! gate and the audit trail then run on the controller as well.
//!
//! This file holds the request flow. The two-person gate and the records it
//! builds live in `gate`, the ISR departures in `leave`, and the
//! wrong-controller refusal in `wire`.
