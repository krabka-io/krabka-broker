//! The partition changes that take a broker out of every ISR before its
//! registration is dropped.
//!
//! Kafka's `ReplicationControlManager.handleBrokerUnregistered` runs
//! `generateLeaderAndIsrUpdates` with the broker to remove, then appends the
//! `UnregisterBrokerRecord`, all in one record list. Every ISR that names the
//! broker loses it, and every partition it leads elects another acceptable
//! replica. That is what the dead-broker failover scan computes, so this
//! module asks it about the broker.
//!
//! Only the active controller may call this. Its image is the one that the
//! partition records are built from, and any other node's image can trail the
//! controller's, so the handler forwards the request to the active controller
//! and refuses it anywhere else.

/// stopped heartbeating. The registry of this controller term is the one
/// `AlterPartition` reads, so a request served right after a failover does not
