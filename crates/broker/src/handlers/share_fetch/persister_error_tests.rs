//! Handler tests for how `ShareFetch` and `ShareAcknowledge` answer when the
//! share-state persister fails.
//!
//! Kafka's `SharePartition.maybeInitialize` fails the share partition when
//! `ReadShareGroupState` fails, and `SharePartitionManager` removes it from
//! its cache, so the next request reads again. A failed
//! `WriteShareGroupState` rolls the acknowledgement back
//! (`SharePartition.rollbackOrProcessStateUpdates`), and the client gets the
//! error that `SharePartition.fetchPersisterError` maps. A fenced state epoch
//! maps to `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER` and drops the partition from the cache.
