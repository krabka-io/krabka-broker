//! Handler tests for how `ShareFetch` answers a partition row by the kind of
//! topic id that the row carries.
//!
//! Kafka's `ErroneousAndValidPartitionData` answers `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_ID` for
//! every partition of the share session whose topic id does not resolve, the
//! zero id included. It does this before the topic `Read` authorization. When
//! the request carries acknowledgements,
//! `KafkaApis.getAcknowledgeBatchesFromShareFetchRequest` also answers
//! `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_ID` as the acknowledge error of those partitions.
