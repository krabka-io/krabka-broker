//! End-to-end tests for issue #948: `ShareFetch` used to close the connection
//! once the log start offset moved past the share-partition start offset
//! (SPSO), because the log read that materialization and acquisition both
//! start from answered `OffsetTooLow` and the handler propagated it.
//!
//! Kafka's `ShareFetchUtils.processFetchResponse` catches the equivalent
//! `OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE` from the log read, calls
//! `SharePartition.updateCacheAndOffsets` to archive the `Available` records
//! below the new log start and move the SPSO and SPEO, and answers the
//! partition with `NONE`, retrying the fetch so a record already readable at
//! or above the new log start is not held back for another round trip. These
//! tests drive that same scenario against a live broker: produce records,
//! move the log start with a real `DeleteRecords`, and fetch again.
