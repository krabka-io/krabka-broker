//! Handler tests for how the `ShareFetch` byte limit bounds acquisition.
//!
//! Kafka reads the log first and acquires second: `SharePartition.acquire`
//! acquires no offset past the last batch that the read returned. Every
//! offset in `AcquiredRecords` therefore has its record in `Records`. The Java
//! share consumer treats an acquired offset with no record as a gap, and
//! acknowledges it as `Gap`, which archives the record without delivery.
