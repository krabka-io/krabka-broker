//! The KIP-966 path that hands an unclean election to the Unclean Recovery
//! Manager instead of electing from the metadata image.
//!
//! A topic with an offset-aware recovery strategy needs the log state of its
//! surviving replicas before a leader can be picked, and the manager owns the
//! append that elects one. This module spends the break-glass approval first,
//! queues the job, and waits out the operator deadline for its outcome.
