//! `OffsetFetch` (`api_key=9`). Reads from `Group.committed_offsets`.
//!
//! For v0 to v7, the request carries the legacy single-group fields:
//! `group_id` and `topics: Option<Vec<OffsetFetchRequestTopic>>`. From v8,
//! KIP-516 moves to a per-group `groups[]` array, and at v10 it keys topics by
//! `topic_id`. `handle_groups` serves that path.
//!
//! The internal offset storage stays keyed by name, so the handler resolves
//! topic ids to names at the wire boundary and echoes the ids back on the
//! response.
//!
//! From v7 the request also carries KIP-447's `require_stable`. It is a
//! top-level field, so it applies to every group the request names, and it
//! turns any partition an unresolved transaction has written into an
//! `UNSTABLE_OFFSET_COMMIT` row instead of the older stable offset. `unstable`
//! builds that row for both response shapes.
//!
//! The two request shapes are byte-exact contracts with different clients, so
//! each keeps its own module: `legacy` for v0 to v7 and `groups` for v8 and
//! above. They share the group-level gate in `authz` and the coordinator read
//! in `committed`. This file holds only the entry point that picks the shape.
