//! KIP-951 `NodeEndpoints` for the `Produce` response: the address of every
//! node a partition row names in its `CurrentLeader` hint.
//!
//! The hint alone is a node id and an epoch. A Java producer's `Sender` hands
//! the response's `nodeEndpoints()` to `Metadata.updatePartitionLeadership`,
//! and with an empty array it cannot resolve the new leader's address. It logs
//! that the leader node is not known and falls back to a full `Metadata`
//! round-trip, which is exactly the round-trip KIP-951 removes.

/// `connection_listener_name` is the listener the request arrived on. Kafka
/// answers with the advertised address of that listener, so a client on the

/// selection that `Metadata` and `DescribeCluster` project a broker with.
///
/// A node the image does not know contributes no entry: there is no address to
/// advertise for it, and Kafka likewise skips a leader that its metadata cache
/// cannot resolve to a live node.
