//! A benchmark seam over the produce hot path: [`prepare_batch`], the
//! writer's [`build_produce_data`], and the log append behind them.
//!
//! The pipeline that runs these three steps in production
//! ([`super::pipeline::process_partition`]) also holds a partition registry, a
//! writer actor, a transaction coordinator and an idempotent-producer tracker,
//! none of which the verbatim-versus-owned question depends on. This module is
//! the same three steps with none of that, so `benches/produce.rs` can time
//! the decision and the bytes it moves rather than the actor hand-off.
//!
//! Every step here is the production function. Nothing is re-implemented, and
//! [`append_one_batch`] applies the writer's compression rewrite in the same
//! place [`crate::partition_writer`] applies it.
