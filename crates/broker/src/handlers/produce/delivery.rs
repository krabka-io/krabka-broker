/// [`resolve_delivery_gate`] builds this once per topic, and only for a topic
/// whose `delivery.mode` is `scheduled`. An immediate topic resolves to `None`,
/// so no partition of it reads a clock or looks at a batch timestamp.
///
/// On a scheduled topic a batch's `max_timestamp` is its delivery time. The
/// rejection reads that one v2 header field, which
/// [`krabka_protocol::records::validate_one_v2_batch`] already extracted into
/// `prepare::ValidatedHeader::max_timestamp`. It decodes no record,
/// decompresses no body, and does not change the verbatim-passthrough
/// decision, so a scheduled topic keeps the same zero-copy append an immediate
/// topic gets.
///
/// The gate holds the one KFC-1 rejection that needs no log state.
/// `delivery.schedule.monotonic` is the other one, and it moved into
/// [`krabka_log::Log`]: it is a statement about what the partition already
/// holds, so the test and the append it guards have to be one critical
/// section, and only the log's own lock is that.
