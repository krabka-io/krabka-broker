//! Kafka trunk's `max.decompressed.message.bytes` on the Produce path.
//!
//! `LogValidator` hands the topic's limit to the batch iterator that
//! decompresses a produced batch, and `DefaultRecord.readFrom` refuses a
//! record whose declared body is larger before it allocates the body. The
//! `InvalidRecordException` reaches the client as `INVALID_RECORD`, with no
//! per-record errors and no message, and nothing is appended. Only a
//! compressed batch is iterated that way: an uncompressed one is bounded by
//! `max.message.bytes` alone, and so is a record that the producer sent
//! uncompressed however large it is.
//!
//! krabka has already decompressed the batch by the time this runs
//! ([`super::prepare::prepare_batch`] parses every record of it under the
//! broker-wide `RecordDecompressionPolicy`), so the check is not an allocation
//! guard here. It is the limit the operator set, answered the way Kafka
//! answers it. A verbatim batch is walked a second time to read the record
//! sizes; that second decompression is paid only by a compressed batch on a
//! topic whose limit is below Kafka's default, which is a limit an operator
//! chose on purpose. ponytail: threading the limit into
//! `ValidatedBatch::validate_records_with` would make it one pass, at the cost
//! of a change in krabka-protocol.
