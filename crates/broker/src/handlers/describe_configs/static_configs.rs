//! The idle window `DescribeConfigs` reports beside the dynamic overrides the
//! metadata image holds: `connections.max.idle.ms` and its per-listener
//! overrides.
//!
//! Kafka answers a named BROKER resource with every value the node actually
//! runs with, static ones included, and answers the cluster-default
//! (`--entity-default`) resource with the dynamic cluster-wide values only.
//! These keys go out beside the static `node.id` entry and the KIP-211
//! retention keys, for the same resources they do, and through the same
//! [`config_entry`] builder, so one precedence chain shapes every entry.
//!
//! Every shape below was read off `apache/kafka:4.3.1` running with
//! `connections.max.idle.ms=30000` and
//! `listener.name.plaintext.connections.max.idle.ms=15000`:
//!
//! - `kafka-configs --describe --entity-type brokers --entity-name 1 --all`
//!   reports `connections.max.idle.ms=30000` with the synonym chain
//!   `STATIC_BROKER_CONFIG:…=30000, DEFAULT_CONFIG:…=600000`. So the key is
//!   spelled that way, an operator-set value reads `STATIC_BROKER_CONFIG`, an
//!   unset one falls back to `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, and the default is 600000.
//! - The same describe reports
//!   `listener.name.plaintext.connections.max.idle.ms=15000` as a separate
//!   entry, also at `STATIC_BROKER_CONFIG`, under a lowercased listener name.
//! - `kafka-configs --alter … --add-config connections.max.idle.ms=20000`
//!   fails with `InvalidRequestException: Cannot update these configs
//!   dynamically`, so the key is read-only.
//!
//! Two finer points about the source and the chain were settled the same way,
//! against the same image, by running it twice — once with
//! `connections.max.idle.ms=600000` spelled out and once with the key absent —
//! and diffing the same `--all` describe:
//!
//! - The source is provenance, never a value comparison. The explicit
//!   `connections.max.idle.ms=600000` — the default, spelled out — answers
//!   `synonyms={STATIC_BROKER_CONFIG:connections.max.idle.ms=600000,
//!   DEFAULT_CONFIG:connections.max.idle.ms=600000}`. With the key absent the
//!   same describe answers `synonyms={DEFAULT_CONFIG:…=600000}`. The two
//!   values are identical and the two chains are not, and since an entry's
//!   `config_source` is the source of its chain's head, the two sources
//!   differ too — so an auditor can tell a pinned setting from an inherited
//!   one.
//! - A per-listener entry's chain is its own value first, then the same
//!   broker-wide tail: with both keys set it reads
//!   `{STATIC_BROKER_CONFIG:listener.name.plaintext.connections.max.idle.ms
//!   =15000, STATIC_BROKER_CONFIG:connections.max.idle.ms=600000,
//!   DEFAULT_CONFIG:connections.max.idle.ms=600000}`, and with the
//!   broker-wide key absent the middle element is simply gone. `node.id`,
//!   which has no key behind it, gets the one-element chain
//!   `{STATIC_BROKER_CONFIG:node.id=1}`.
//!
//! The chain itself is conditional: Kafka builds it only for a request that
//! sets `include_synonyms`, and answers every entry with an empty list
//! otherwise, so a caller that was not asked for synonyms must not
//! synthesise any. [`config_entry`] is what holds that rule.
//!
//! A per-listener key is a key per listener rather than a registry row, so
//! every one of them is reported under the broker-wide
//! [`CONNECTIONS_MAX_IDLE_MS`] row: it is the same config under Kafka's
//! `ListenerName.configPrefix`, and it is that row that carries the type the
//! JVM `AdminClient` parses the value with, the documentation, and the
//! read-only flag.
//!
//! One behaviour is krabka's own, and the container is what settled it: with
//! the per-listener key set to 15000 above, a raw TCP connection to the
//! PLAINTEXT listener that sent nothing was closed after 30 seconds, not 15.
//! Kafka reports `listener.name.<name>.connections.max.idle.ms` and then
//! ignores it -- its `DataPlaneAcceptor` takes `max.connections` and
//! `max.connection.creation.rate` per listener, but the idle window only
//! broker-wide. krabka honours the override, because a listener facing the
//! internet and a listener facing the cluster want different windows. The
//! reported shape is Kafka's; only the effect is a superset, and nothing on
//! the wire changes.
