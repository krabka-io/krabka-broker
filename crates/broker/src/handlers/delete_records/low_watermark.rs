//! The follower half of a `DeleteRecords` trim: the low watermark a row
//! answers, and the wait for the followers to reach the trim point.
//!
//! Kafka moves the log start offset on every replica. The leader trims its own
//! log, each follower raises its log start to the leader's from its next Fetch
//! response, and reports the new start in the Fetch after that. The leader's
//! `ReplicaManager.deleteRecords` parks the request in the `DeleteRecords`
//! purgatory until `Partition.lowWatermarkIfLeader` (the lowest log start of
//! the leader and every live follower) reaches the requested offset. A row
//! that does not get there within the request's `timeout_ms` answers
//! `REQUEST_TIMED_OUT` with the low watermark it had when the trim ran.
//!
//! Without the wait a client is told its records are gone while a follower
//! still holds them, and a leader change serves them again.
