//! The `Describe` and `Delete` ACL checks that gate `DeleteTopics`.
//!
//! Kafka checks `Delete` on the `Cluster` resource once, as a shortcut: an
//! Allow there makes every candidate topic describable and deletable without
//! a further lookup. A Deny is not a whole-request failure -- it falls back to
//! `Describe` and `Delete` on each `Topic(name)` individually
//! (`ControllerApis.handleDeleteTopics`/`deleteTopics`), so a principal
//! scoped to a literal or prefixed topic ACL can still delete the topics its
//! ACL covers.
//!
//! The two decisions are separate because they answer different rows. A name
//! row the principal may not describe answers `TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED`
//! before the existence check, so a caller cannot tell a hidden topic from an
//! absent one. An id row the principal may not delete carries the topic name
//! only when the principal may describe the topic.
