//! KFC-9: the break-glass two-person rule over a topic deletion.
//!
//! A deletion destroys every record the topic holds, so it is gated. This
//! module builds the record list one deletion appends -- the consumed proposal
//! ahead of the delete record, so a single raft append carries both -- and
//! reads back the proposal that list spends. The freeze check that answers
//! ahead of this gate stays in the module root.

/// The records one topic deletion appends.

/// The consumed break-glass proposal goes first, and the delete record follows
/// it, so one raft append carries both. That single append is what stops an
/// approval from being spent twice across a crash: a broker that committed the
/// deletion has committed the consume with it.
///
/// A broker whose `[break_glass]` names no approver gates nothing, and the
/// answer is then the delete record alone.

/// Returns the [`BreakGlassDenial`] when no approved proposal covers this
/// topic. The caller answers `POLICY_VIOLATION (44)` on that topic's row.
