//! Unwraps the leader's `EnvelopeResponse` to a forwarded `DescribeQuorum`
//! back into the plain `DescribeQuorumResponse` body a caller expects. The
//! request side is wrapped in a KIP-590 `Envelope` by the shared
//! [`crate::handlers::forward_to_controller::build`].
//!
//! [`krabka_raft::ControllerHandle::forward_raw`] dials the leader's
//! controller listener as THIS node's own inter-broker service identity, not
//! the caller's. Forwarding the bare `DescribeQuorumRequest` bytes at
//! `api_key=55` would have the leader's controller listener re-authorize
//! `Describe` against that service identity instead of the caller who
//! already passed [`crate::handlers::cluster_describe_denied`] on this node --
//! fencing out a legitimately-authorized caller for the sole reason that it
//! happened to land on a follower (review of #1034). Sending an `Envelope`
//! (`api_key=58`, KIP-590) instead carries the caller's own principal and
//! address across the hop, so the leader's `controller_admin::serve_envelope`
//! reconstructs a `RequestContext` under the identity that actually asked,
//! and [`super::handle`] re-runs the same `Describe` gate correctly on the
//! leader.
