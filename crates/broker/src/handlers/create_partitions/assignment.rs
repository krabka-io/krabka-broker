/// Resolve the replica list for each newly-added partition.
///
/// `provided` is the caller's `assignments` field. `None` selects the
/// automatic site-aware placement. `Some(...)` is used verbatim, after each
/// list passes Kafka's `validateManualPartitionAssignment` against the
/// registered `brokers` and the topic's replication factor `rf`. The caller
/// has already checked that it holds one list per new partition.
///
/// `new_partition_count` is `new_count - existing`. It is always above 0 by
/// the time this helper runs, because the `INVALID_PARTITIONS` check runs
/// earlier.
///
/// On the automatic path the helper places just the new partitions, with a
/// fresh random start. Kafka's `createPartitions` does the same: it hands the
/// placer `numPartitions = additional` and the placer ignores the index of the
/// first new partition, so the new partitions do not continue the rotation of
/// the existing ones.
///
/// It returns one replica list per new partition, in `existing..new_count`
/// order. It returns an `(error_code, error_message)` pair with Kafka's
/// message instead when the request is invalid, and the caller stamps that
/// pair into the per-topic result.
