//! `DescribeConfigs` (`api_key=32`). It answers with a resource's effective
//! configuration and the provenance of every value in it.
//!
//! - `resource_type=2` (TOPIC): the handler reports every key in
//!   [`crate::config_keys::registry`], not only the ones the topic overrides.
//!   An override reports `DYNAMIC_TOPIC_CONFIG (1)`; a key the cluster-default
//!   broker config supplies reports `DYNAMIC_DEFAULT_BROKER_CONFIG (3)`; the
//!   rest report `DEFAULT_CONFIG (5)`.
//! - `resource_type=4` (BROKER): a numeric name returns the effective dynamic
//!   per-broker and cluster-default overrides, plus the settings read from
//!   the serving process itself, and every other non-internal key of Kafka
//!   4.3.1's `KafkaConfig` at its default ([`crate::config_keys::kafka_broker`]).
//!   An empty name returns the cluster-wide defaults, each stored key typed by
//!   the same roster: only a `PASSWORD` key and a name Kafka does not define
//!   are withheld. Sources distinguish `DYNAMIC_BROKER_CONFIG (2)` from
//!   `DYNAMIC_DEFAULT_BROKER_CONFIG (3)` and `STATIC_BROKER_CONFIG (4)`. A
//!   numeric name that is not this node is refused with `INVALID_REQUEST`,
//!   which is what `ConfigHelper` in the pinned image does; the JVM
//!   `AdminClient` never sends one, because it routes a broker resource to
//!   the node it names.
//! - `resource_type=16` (`CLIENT_METRICS`) and `resource_type=32` (GROUP) report
//!   their own effective values the same way.
//! - `resource_type=8` (`BROKER_LOGGER`) reports this node's live `tracing`
//!   targets and their effective levels at `DYNAMIC_BROKER_LOGGER_CONFIG (6)`.
//!   The resource is node-local, so its name must be this broker's id.
//! - Any other resource type refuses the whole request: every resource in it is
//!   answered `INVALID_REQUEST` with no configs, which is what Kafka's
//!   `ConfigHelper` does when it throws on the type. The JVM `AdminClient`
//!   never sends one.
//!
//! Each entry carries the typed metadata `ConfigEntry` exposes: the
//! `ConfigDef` type byte the client parses the value with, the documentation
//! when the request set `include_documentation`, the synonym chain when it set
//! `include_synonyms`, and `is_sensitive` with the value withheld when the key
//! is one the broker must not disclose. All of it comes from the registry, so
//! `kafka-configs --describe --all` reads the same facts the validator
//! enforces. [`entry`] holds the shaping and the chain order.
//!
//! A broker config that only the controller writes comes back with
//! `read_only` set, next to the static `node.id` entry. See
//! [`crate::config_keys::CONTROLLER_MANAGED_BROKER_CONFIGS`].
//!
//! A numeric broker resource carries five more synthesised read-only keys
//! beside `node.id`: KIP-211's
//! [`offsets.retention.minutes`](crate::config_keys::OFFSETS_RETENTION_MINUTES)
//! and
//! [`offsets.retention.check.interval.ms`](crate::config_keys::OFFSETS_RETENTION_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS),
//! KIP-98's
//! [`transactional.id.expiration.ms`](crate::config_keys::TRANSACTIONAL_ID_EXPIRATION_MS)
//! and
//! [`transaction.remove.expired.transaction.cleanup.interval.ms`](crate::config_keys::TRANSACTION_REMOVE_EXPIRED_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS),
//! and the idle window in [`static_configs`] —
//! [`connections.max.idle.ms`](crate::config_keys::CONNECTIONS_MAX_IDLE_MS)
//! together with its per-listener overrides, which are a key per listener
//! rather than a registry row. The process reads all of them once at startup,
//! so no alter can change them and `kafka-configs` must say so. The
//! cluster-default broker resource (an empty `resource_name`) reports dynamic
//! defaults only, which is what Kafka does.
//!
//! The `config_source` of each is provenance and not a value comparison: a key
//! an operator wrote reads `STATIC_BROKER_CONFIG` above the built-in default
//! even when what they wrote is Kafka's own default; one left alone reports
//! that default alone.
//!
//! One stored topic override is read-only too:
//! [`crate::config_keys::DISKLESS`]. A partition reads the data-path flag once,
//! when it is opened, so both alter paths refuse to change it and
//! `kafka-configs` must say so.
//!
//! A topic resource carries one synthesised key beside its stored overrides:
//! KFC-9's [`crate::config_keys::WRITE_FREEZE`]. It is read-only for the same
//! reason. The handler reads it from the freeze registry and not from the
//! topic's override map, because a freeze is never stored as a topic config.
//! The value names the state:
//!
//! - A frozen topic reads `frozen:` and then the registry scope that matched,
//!   for example `frozen:prefixed:tenant-a.` or `frozen:literal:orders`. The
//!   part after `frozen:` is [`crate::freeze::freeze_target`]. The operator
//!   reads one vocabulary here, in the produce-path refusal, in the audit
//!   events, and in a break-glass target. The scope also says whether the
//!   freeze names this topic or covers it through a namespace prefix.
//! - Any other topic reads `false`, at `DEFAULT_CONFIG`. The handler emits the
//!   key when no freeze covers the topic, and for an internal topic, which is
//!   never freezable. An absent key reads the same as a broker that has no
//!   write-freeze feature. The operator cannot separate those two states.
//!
//! The handler honors the `configuration_keys` filter on the request. When the
//! client supplies a non-empty key list, the response holds only those keys. A
//! null list and an empty list both ask for every key, which is what Kafka's
//! `ConfigHelperUtils.toDescribeConfigsResult` does. The synthesised key obeys
//! that filter like every stored key.
