//! The transactional sub-path of `InitProducerId`: coordinator-side
//! allocation, epoch bump, and KIP-939 recovery of a prepared transaction.
//!
//! Once the request has passed the ACL preamble and this broker is confirmed
//! as the coordinator for the transactional id, everything that follows is one
//! state machine over the persisted `TxnEntry`. A fresh id allocates, a
//! prepared id is recovered, and a reused id aborts any ongoing transaction
//! before it bumps the epoch, so the transitions and the abort-marker fan-out
//! they depend on stay together.
