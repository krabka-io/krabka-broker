//! Handler tests for the high watermark that a follower `Fetch` reports.
//!
//! Kafka's `Partition.fetchRecords` reads a follower's records first, and only
//! then records the follower's fetch offset (`updateFollowerFetchState`). When
//! that first read answers the fetch, the row carries the high watermark from
//! before the follower's own fetch offset counted toward it. When the fetch
//! parks, `DelayedFetch.onComplete` reads every partition again, on a wake or
//! on expiry, and the row carries the high watermark that the fetch moved.
//!
//! So the follower learns a high watermark one fetch after the leader.
//! `kafka-replica-verification.sh` reads the high watermark of every replica
//! and reports the gap between them as replica lag. Its system test expects a
//! nonzero lag while records arrive.
//!
//! The broker under test is node 1 and leads every partition. Node 2 follows
//! and never fetches on its own, so only the fetches of a case move the high
//! watermark. Each case appends two one-record batches, at offsets 0 and 1.
