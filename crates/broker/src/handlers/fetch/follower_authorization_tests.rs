//! Handler tests for the `ClusterAction` gate on a follower `Fetch`.
//!
//! Kafka's `KafkaApis.handleFetchRequest` treats a fetch whose replica id is 0
//! or more as a follower fetch. The replica id is `ReplicaId` before v15 and
//! `ReplicaState.ReplicaId` from v15 on. A follower fetch reads up to the log
//! end offset and moves the follower progress, and so the high watermark.
//! Kafka lets it through only when the principal holds `ClusterAction` on the
//! cluster resource, and then it checks no topic ACL. Without `ClusterAction`,
//! every partition row answers `TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED`, and the fetch
//! reads nothing.
//!
//! A consumer fetch keeps its replica id at -1, also when it names a rack to
//! read from a follower replica (KIP-392). It needs topic `Read`.
//!
//! Each case replicates its own topic from this broker (node 1) to a node 2
//! that never fetches, so the high watermark stays at 0 until a fetch as node
//! 2 moves it.
