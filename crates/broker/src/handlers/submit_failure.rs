/// The controller leader refuses a break-glass consume or a topic-freeze
/// replacement with [`RaftError::UncommittedTail`] while its log holds records
/// that are not committed. A new leader is in that state until it commits a
/// record from its own epoch. Kafka's controller is not active in the same
/// window, and it answers `NOT_CONTROLLER`. A Kafka admin client treats that
/// code as retriable: it finds the active controller again and retries the
/// call. So this function answers `NOT_CONTROLLER` for that refusal.
///
/// Every other failure answers `otherwise`, the code that the handler uses for
/// a failed submit.
