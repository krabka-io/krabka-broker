//! The KIP-966 eligible-leader-replica seam of the failover-scan model: the
//! metadata image the real maintenance rule reads, and the call that
//! recomputes the published set after every change the model makes.
//!
//! The model does not choose the set. Every transition that moves the leader
//! or the ISR calls the real
//! [`next_partition_elr`](crate::elr::maintain::next_partition_elr), which is
//! what [`ElrPublisher`](crate::elr::ElrPublisher) runs over every controller
//! batch, so `failover_one` only ever reads a set a controller could have
//! published. Whether the members so published really hold every committed
//! record is a claim about logs, which this model does not carry;
//! `data_path_model`'s `data_elr` configuration checks it.
