//! The bounded configuration of the failover-scan model, the state its search
//! enumerates, the actions that move between two states, and the projection
//! onto the `PartitionRecord` that the real `failover_one` reads.
//!
//! Order is significant: the replica order is what every pick walks -- the
//! clean one, the KIP-966 ELR one and the KIP-841 one, as Kafka's
//! `electAnyLeader` does -- and the emitted ISR keeps the ISR order, so both
//! stay `Vec` rather than a set. The assignment is `[1, 3, 2]` rather than
//! sorted, because an ISR that a re-admission rebuilt is sorted by id: a
//! partition whose ISR holds 2 and 3 then lists them in the opposite order to
//! the assignment, which is what tells a clean pick that walks the ISR apart
//! from Kafka's.
