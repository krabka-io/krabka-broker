//! The stateright [`Model`] implementation for KIP-966 winner selection: the
//! fan-out over the bounded response domain and the properties that state what
//! `select_leader` and `has_newer_leader` must compute.
//!
//! A `Model` implementation is one indivisible unit, because the action
//! generator, the transition and the properties only make sense against each
//! other, so it stays whole in this file. The state it gathers lives in the
//! sibling `recovery_state` module.
//!
//! # What this model can and cannot say about the ELR rule
//!
//! `select_leader` elects a surviving eligible leader replica ahead of a
//! longer log and reports that election as losing nothing. There are two
//! separate claims in that sentence, and only one of them is checkable here.
//!
//! The *ordering* is: which replica the rule picks, out of which group, given
//! a published set and a witness set. That is a function of the responses and
//! nothing else, and this model checks it exhaustively -- including that the
//! shortest ELR member outranks the longest non-member, that an ELR member
//! that did not answer cannot be elected, and that no rule elects a witness.
//!
//! The *losslessness* is: that the replica so elected really does hold every
//! record the partition acknowledged. That is not a claim about selection at
//! all, it is a claim about how the controller maintained the published set,
//! and this model holds no logs, no committed prefix and no ELR maintenance to
//! check it against. `data_path_model`'s `data_elr` configuration is where
//! that half lives: it runs the real `next_partition_elr` over a partition
//! whose per-replica logs it also carries, and states the losslessness as a
//! property over both. Neither half is worth much without the other.
