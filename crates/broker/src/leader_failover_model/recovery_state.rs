//! The bounded configuration of the KIP-966 winner-selection model, the
//! gathered responses its search enumerates, and the projection onto the real
//! `ReplicaLogInfo`.
//!
//! The model state has to be hashable for the search, and `ReplicaLogInfo` is
//! not, so the reported log state is mirrored here and converted on the way
//! into the production selectors.
//!
//! # The published sets are configuration, not state
//!
//! `select_leader` reads three things: the responses, the partition's
//! eligible-leader-replica set, and the cluster's witnesses. Only the first
//! moves while a recovery runs -- the ELR was published before the poll
//! started and the witness set is a static role -- so the search enumerates
//! responses and the model is instantiated once per published set. That keeps
//! the two sets orthogonal to the state space instead of multiplying it, and
//! it lets a configuration name an ELR member that never answers, which is a
//! case the election has to get right.
