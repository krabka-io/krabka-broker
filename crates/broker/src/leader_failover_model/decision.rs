//! The per-decision safety invariants: what must hold of one `failover_one`
//! result given the state the controller saw before it.
//!
//! These checks run inside the transition rather than as stateright
//! properties, because they relate a decision to its own pre-state. A property
//! only sees the states, and the pre-state is gone by the time the successor
//! is checked.
//!
//! The rules are stated from Apache Kafka rather than read off
//! `failover_one`. `ReplicationControlManager.handleBrokerFenced` visits only
//! the partitions whose ISR holds the broker, and hands
//! `PartitionChangeBuilder` a target ISR that is the old one without that
//! broker, and nothing else. `electAnyLeader` keeps the current leader while it
//! is a valid new leader of that target, and otherwise walks the ladder: the
//! first acceptable target-ISR member in assignment order; with no live target
//! ISR, the first acceptable eligible leader replica in assignment order,
//! reported clean; only then krabka's offset-aware recovery, and last the
//! KIP-841 election of the first acceptable replica, reported unclean. Each
//! decision is checked to have taken the highest rung the pre-state offered,
//! so a data-losing rung is never chosen while a cleaner one was available.
