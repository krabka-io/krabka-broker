//! The controller half of KIP-966: recompute a partition's ELR whenever a
//! change to it is about to be submitted, and publish the result.
//!
//! ## The rules, and where they come from
//!
//! Apache Kafka keeps the rules in `PartitionChangeBuilder`, which assembles
//! one `PartitionChangeRecord` per partition change. Read out of tag 4.3.1,
//! the two sets it publishes are
//!
//! ```text
//! // the eligible set: maybePopulateTargetElr, then maybeUpdateRecordElr
//! if (targetIsr.size() >= minISR) { targetElr = []; }
//! else { targetElr = (elr ∪ isr) − targetIsr − uncleanShutdownReplicas; }
//! if (the change installs an ISR of its own) { targetElr = []; }
//!
//! // the last-known set: maybeUpdateLastKnownLeader
//! if (the change leaves no leader && lastKnownElr is empty) { lastKnownElr = [previous leader]; }
//! else if (the change gives a leader && lastKnownElr is not empty) { lastKnownElr = []; }
//! ```
//!
//! with `elr`, `isr` and `lastKnownElr` read from the partition as it stands
//! before the change and `targetIsr` the ISR the change installs. A change
//! installs an ISR of its own, in Kafka, only on an unclean election: the
//! replica it elects need not hold every committed record, so nothing that
//! came before is still known to be complete.
//!
//! `maybePopulateTargetElr` also works out a multi-member last-known set,
//! `(candidates ∪ lastKnownElr) − targetIsr − targetElr`, but it is never
//! published: `useLastKnownLeaderInBalancedRecovery` defaults to `true`,
//! nothing in `ReplicationControlManager` turns it off, and with it on
//! `maybeUpdateRecordElr` returns before it would write that set. The last-known
//! ELR that Kafka publishes is therefore one replica, the last leader, and only
//! while the partition has no leader. [`crate::leader_election`] elects that
//! replica when it returns (`canElectLastKnownLeader`).
//!
//! [`next_partition_elr`] is those rules, `uncleanShutdownReplicas` included:
//! [`ElrPublisher::after_unclean_shutdown`] is how a batch names one, and it
//! subtracts the replica from the eligible set and from nothing else. krabka
//! subtracts a second set Kafka does not, the replicas that are no longer in
//! the replica set, because the partition can no longer elect them. One
//! difference is krabka's: the unclean-election test is "the elected leader
//! was in neither the previous ISR nor the ELR" rather than "the change
//! carries an ISR", because krabka's election paths always carry one.
//!
//! ## A partition without a leader
//!
//! Kafka writes `leader = -1` when no rung of the election ladder can elect,
//! together with the ELR the shortened ISR implies and the last leader as the
//! last-known ELR. A krabka `PartitionRecord` always names a leader, so the
//! controller scans leave the record alone -- a dead leader dropped from its
//! own ISR would be a leader outside it -- and publish the rest through
//! [`ElrPublisher::leaderless`]. The record keeps the last leader and its ISR,
//! and the one-member last-known ELR that names it is what says the partition
//! has no leader (see [`is_leaderless`](super::state::is_leaderless)). Read
//! against that marker, the last leader is not in the ISR any more, which is
//! where Kafka's ISR went empty; [`next_partition_elr`] takes it out of the
//! ISRs it reads for that reason, so every later change derives from the state
//! Kafka would hold.
//!
//! Any change that gives the partition a leader, that is to say a different
//! one or the same one under a higher leader epoch, publishes the last-known
//! ELR empty again. A change that keeps both, an ISR shrink for another
//! replica, keeps the marker.
//!
//! Kafka reaches `uncleanShutdownReplicas` from
//! `ReplicationControlManager.handleBrokerShutdown`, whose unclean branch is
//! a broker rejoining without a clean-shutdown proof. krabka answers that
//! event in two places, one per Kafka call:
//! [`withdraw_elr_membership`](crate::elr::withdraw_elr_membership) withdraws
//! the published membership, and
//! [`compute_unclean_restart_changes`](crate::leader_election::compute_unclean_restart_changes)
//! drops the broker from the ISRs that still name it and runs this publisher
//! over the result with the broker excluded. A restart that does prove itself
//! clean reaches neither.
//!
//! Kafka gates the whole thing on the `eligible.leader.replicas.version`
//! feature: `ReplicationControlManager` builds every `PartitionChangeBuilder`
//! with `setEligibleLeaderReplicasEnabled(isElrEnabled())`, so at level 0 no
//! partition ever gains an eligible set or a last-known leader. krabka
//! registers the same feature, and [`ElrPublisher::extend`] publishes nothing
//! while it is below level 1. The read side needs no gate of its own: a
//! cluster that never published an ELR has none to read, and a downgrade to 0
//! clears what an earlier level 1 left behind.
//!
//! ## What gets published
//!
//! [`ElrPublisher::extend`] reads the partition changes a controller path has
//! already built, works out the ELR each of their partitions ends up with,
//! and appends one `V1PartitionElr` per partition whose rendered value moved.
//! The partitions the controller reports as left without a leader are treated
//! the same way. Legacy topic-config state is migrated first; removing its
//! private key keeps every other topic override from the batch or image
//! intact.
//!
//! Nothing is appended when nothing moved, which is the common case: while
//! every partition keeps a leader, a cluster that leaves `min.insync.replicas`
//! at Kafka's default of 1 can never have a non-empty ELR, because an ISR that
//! reached zero members has no partition record to reach it with.
