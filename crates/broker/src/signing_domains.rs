//! Domain separators for the operator signatures that KFC-9 defines.
//!
//! A signature over one kind of message must never verify as another kind. So
//! every signing scheme in this workspace puts a distinct constant in front of
//! its canonical bytes, and the verifier rebuilds those bytes with the same
//! constant. Two schemes that share a separator let an attacker present a
//! captured signature for a purpose the signer never agreed to.
//!
//! `crates/remote-storage/src/worm/manifest.rs` states the same rule. It gives
//! the segment manifest [`crabka_remote_storage::MANIFEST_DOMAIN`] and the
//! chain preimage [`crabka_remote_storage::MANIFEST_BODY_DOMAIN`], and it
//! deliberately does not share [`crabka_audit::signing::CHECKPOINT_DOMAIN`],
//! even though both schemes sign with the same Ed25519 keys and the same
//! verifier.
//!
//! The two constants sit in one module of their own, and not beside the code
//! that builds each canonical layout, because the freeze path and the
//! break-glass path are separate modules. The tests below compare every domain
//! separator in the workspace against every other one. A test inside either
//! path would have to reach into the other path for its constant.
