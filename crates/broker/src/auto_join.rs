//! KIP-853 controller auto-join.
//!
//! A broker started in [`crate::BootstrapMode::Join`] with
//! `auto_join = true` is NOT yet a member of the controller raft group: its
//! Raft log is empty and it waits as an observer. This module
//! drives the joiner side of the dance — it discovers the leader via the
//! configured `bootstrap_servers` and sends the **Kafka `AddRaftVoter` wire
//! RPC** (`api_key` 80) carrying its own voter identity. The leader-side
//! handler (`crate::handlers::add_raft_voter`) waits for the observer to catch
//! up and appends the authoritative `VotersRecord`. Once the joiner sees its
//! exact node and directory identity in the committed voter set it stops.
//!
//! The joiner advertises its **real bound** controller endpoint (not the
//! configured `controller_listen_addr`, which may carry port 0 for an
//! OS-assigned port) so the leader's `add_learner` can dial it back.
//!
//! This is purely a client-side driver: it does NOT touch the reconfiguration
//! Raft state directly. All lockstep safety lives in the leader's single-owner
//! Raft engine.
//!
//! The two background tasks the module exposes — [`run`] for the join itself
//! and [`run_voter_updates`] for the endpoint advertisement — live in
//! `join_loop` and `voter_updates`. The pieces they share sit in `request`
//! (identity and request construction), `rpc` (the one-shot wire calls) and
//! `outcome` (reply classification).
