//! The one answer to "does the broker own this topic".
//!
//! `Metadata` and `DescribeTopicPartitions` both fill the `is_internal` flag of
//! a topic row from [`is_internal_topic`], so a client sees the same answer
//! whichever RPC it asks with. The flag is what hides a topic from
//! `AdminClient.listTopics()`, from `kafka-topics --list --exclude-internal`,
//! and from a consumer that subscribes by pattern with the default
//! `exclude.internal.topics=true`. A broker-owned topic that answers `false` is
//! one a `.*` mirroring or audit sink silently starts consuming.
//!
//! # The set is the subsystems' own names
//!
//! Every entry of [`INTERNAL_TOPICS`] is the constant the owning subsystem
//! already declares for its topic, never a second spelling of the name. A new
//! internal topic is covered the day its constant lands, by naming that
//! constant here.
//!
//! The audit log is the one broker-owned topic whose name is not a constant:
//! `krabka.audit.topic` renames it, and every audit code path reads
//! [`BrokerConfig::audit_topic`] rather than a literal. So [`is_internal_topic`]
//! takes the config and compares against the name the broker is actually
//! auditing to, which is why it is not the pure static predicate Kafka's
//! `Topic.isInternal` can afford to be — Kafka has no rename knob.
//! [`validate_audit_topic_name`] keeps that name inside the `__` convention so
//! the freeze rule below stays in step with this one.
//!
//! # What Kafka reports as internal
//!
//! Kafka's own set is a fixed three names — `__consumer_offsets`,
//! `__transaction_state` and `__share_group_state` — and it does **not**
//! include `__remote_log_metadata`, whose tiered-storage records are
//! broker-owned in spirit but ordinary on the wire. That was settled against
//! the pinned images rather than the wiki, two ways that agree: the
//! `INTERNAL_TOPICS` set in `org.apache.kafka.common.internals.Topic` inside
//! each image's `kafka-clients` jar, and creating all four names on a running
//! broker and diffing `kafka-topics --list` against
//! `kafka-topics --list --exclude-internal`. `apache/kafka:4.3.1` and
//! `apache/kafka:4.0.0` report the three; `confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.5.0`
//! predates KIP-932 and reports the first two, leaving `__share_group_state`
//! ordinary because it has no share coordinator to own it. Krabka does have
//! one, so it follows the 4.x answer.
//!
//! The remaining entries are Krabka's own: the audit log, the barrier state
//! topic, and the diskless WAL index. Kafka has no name for them and so no
//! opinion about them, and each carries broker state that no application should
//! read as a data topic.
