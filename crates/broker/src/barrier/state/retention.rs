/// The group keeps its last `retained_cuts` cuts, so every held epoch at or
/// below `published - retained_cuts` falls off. `held` is the set of epochs
/// the group still carries, and it does not hold `published` yet. A group edit
/// that reduced `retained_cuts` drops more than one epoch at once. A
/// `retained_cuts` that is not positive drops nothing, and
