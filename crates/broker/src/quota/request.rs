//! KIP-124 `request_percentage` helper.
//!
//! The request quota throttles on the server-side time a request takes, as a
//! percentage of one request-handler thread. The per-connection dispatch loop
//! calls this helper for most APIs. The `Produce` and `Fetch` handlers call it
//! inline, so that the broker can combine the request throttle with the
//! byte-rate data throttle, with `max`, into one `throttle_time_ms` and one
//! channel mute (KIP-219).

/// Consumes `elapsed_micros` of request-handler time from the

/// response. The delay is a zero extent when no quota is configured, when the
/// rate is not positive, or when there was no overage. `maximum_delay`, one
/// `quota.window.size.seconds` in Kafka, caps the returned delay.
///
/// `request_percentage` is a percentage of one thread-second, so `100.0` gives
/// a budget of 1 000 000 µs per second. The bucket therefore meters in
/// microseconds, the same unit as `elapsed_micros`.
