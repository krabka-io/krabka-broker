/// The KIP-219 throttle window a handler computed for the request in flight.
///
/// KIP-219 splits a quota violation in two. The response tells the client how
/// long to back off, and the broker enforces that window by muting the
/// connection *after* the response bytes are on the wire. The window itself is
/// computed deep inside the quota code, so the handler records it here and the
/// per-connection dispatch loop reads it back once the write has completed.
///
/// Sleeping inside the handler instead is the pre-KIP-219 behaviour KIP-219
/// replaced: the client's `request.timeout.ms` fires during the stall, the
/// client retries, and the retry adds load to the very quota that is shedding
/// it.
///
/// A request can trip more than one quota — a produce charges both
/// `producer_byte_rate` and `request_percentage`. Recording therefore keeps the
/// longest window rather than summing, which matches Kafka's single
/// `throttle_time_ms` and single channel mute per request.
