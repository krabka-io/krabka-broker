//! Expiry of quota buckets, and of the metric series they carry.
//!
//! A bucket is created the first time a principal and client id are charged
//! against a quota, and nothing removed one. A cluster that sees ten thousand
//! distinct client ids over a week therefore kept ten thousand buckets and, as
//! of KIP-599's per-entity throttle series, ten thousand
//! `quota_entity_throttle_seconds` label sets, for the life of the process --
//! long after the clients behind them stopped connecting.
//!
//! Kafka expires a client's quota sensors after an hour of inactivity
//! (`ClientQuotaManager`'s `InactiveSensorExpirationTimeSeconds`). This is that
//! sweep: it drops every bucket untouched for [`INACTIVE_EXPIRATION`] and
//! releases the metric series each one had materialised, so an inactive
//! tenant's label set leaves the `/metrics` body instead of growing it forever.
//!
//! Reviving a client that was expired costs one bucket allocation and starts it
//! at full burst, which is the same state a first-seen client gets. An hour of
//! silence is longer than any quota window, so the burst it is handed back is
//! one it would have refilled to anyway.
