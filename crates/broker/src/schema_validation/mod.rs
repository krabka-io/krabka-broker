//! KFC-7 broker-side schema validation.
//!
//! A topic can declare that its records carry schemas, and the broker then
//! refuses a produce whose records do not. The check runs on the produce path,
//! reads the schemas from a Confluent-compatible registry, and answers from a
//! bounded cache so that a registry round trip is not a per-record cost.
//!
//! The design is written up in `docs/KFCs/KFC-7-broker-side-schema-validation.md`.
//! Three pieces live here:
//!
//! - [`SchemaGate`], the topic's settings, resolved once per topic in the
//!   produce handler. A topic that has not turned validation on has no gate,
//!   and pays nothing.
//! - [`SchemaValidator`], the registry client and its cache. One per broker.
//! - [`RejectReason`], what came back when a record failed, which becomes both
//!   a metric label and the KIP-467 per-record message the producer sees.
