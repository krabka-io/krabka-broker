//! Kafka 4.3.1's rules for replaying the records of the consumer, share and
//! streams groups, as pure decisions that the replay adapters apply to the
//! seeds.
//!
//! `GroupMetadataManager.replay` looks a group up with
//! `getOrMaybeCreatePersistedConsumerGroup`, `...ShareGroup` or
//! `...StreamsGroup`. A record with a value creates the group it names, and a
//! tombstone of a group that does not exist is ignored. A group of another
//! type is an `IllegalStateException`, except that a consumer or streams
//! record replaces a simple classic group, the empty classic group that an
//! offset commit creates. A tombstone of a member, of the target assignment
//! metadata, or of the group itself checks that the records before it emptied
//! what it removes, and throws `IllegalStateException` otherwise. Kafka's
//! `CoordinatorLoaderImpl` fails the load on any exception that a replay
//! throws, so each such case is an error here.
