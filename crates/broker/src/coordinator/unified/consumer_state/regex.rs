//! The regular-expression subscriptions of a next-gen consumer group and the

//!
//! A member that sends a `SubscribedTopicRegex` subscribes to the topics the
//! pattern resolves to, beside the names it lists. Kafka resolves a pattern for
//! the whole group, not for each member: `TopicRegexResolver` matches every
//! pattern the members use against the topics of the metadata image, keeps the
//! topics that the requesting principal may `Describe`, and the group stores
//! the result, `ConsumerGroup.resolvedRegularExpressions`. A
//! `ConsumerGroupRegularExpression` record persists each entry, so a
//! coordinator failover restores the topics that the patterns had resolved to.
//! The group refreshes a resolution when a heartbeat finds it stale; see
//! `actor::regex_resolution`.
