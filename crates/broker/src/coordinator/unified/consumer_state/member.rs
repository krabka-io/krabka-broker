//! The [`MemberState`] record for one KIP-848 consumer-group member and the
//! [`ClassicMemberFacade`] a classic member carries inside an upgraded group.
//!
//! A member is pure data plus accessors. The group-level transitions that add,
//! remove, and reconcile members live in the `group` and `reconcile` siblings,
//! and the topics that a member's regex subscription resolves to live in the
//! group, in `regex`.
