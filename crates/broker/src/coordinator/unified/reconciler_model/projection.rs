//! The projection between the model state and the real
//! [`GroupState`](crate::coordinator::unified::consumer_state::GroupState).
//!
//! Every transition rebuilds a real group from the enumerated state, drives the
//! real code over it, and projects the result back. Keeping both directions in
//! one file is what makes it easy to see that they are inverses. The
//! epoch-monotonicity check that every transition runs against the rebuilt
//! group lives here too, because it reads the same two representations.
