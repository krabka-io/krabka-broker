//! The stateright [`Model`] implementation: the initial state, the enabled
//! actions, the transition function that drives the real `step_heartbeat`, the
//! search boundary, and the properties the checker proves.
//!
//! The helpers the transitions call live in the sibling modules. This file only
//! sequences them and states what must hold.
