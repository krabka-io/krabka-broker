//! KIP-1331 inside the streams-group actor: asking a member for the topology
//! description, storing what it pushes, and serving it to a describe.
//!
//! Kafka splits this between the shard, which keeps the group's
//! `StoredDescriptionTopologyEpoch` and `FailedDescriptionTopologyEpoch`, and
//! the broker-wide `StreamsGroupTopologyDescriptionManager`, which owns the
//! plugin and the back-off. The actor keeps all three for its group, so each
//! step below runs in the one turn of the actor that handles the message.
//!
//! Kafka trunk writes the group metadata record twice per push, with the
//! epochs in KIP-1331's tags 2 and 3: the `UNCERTAIN` epoch before it calls
//! the plugin, so that a broker that dies between the two writes asks again,
//! and the pushed epoch after. The in-memory plugin stores in the same turn
//! and loses everything with the broker, so the actor writes only the second
//! record. A push reaches the group only while a plugin is configured, which
//! is when the group writes the trunk tags at all (`ActorState::trunk_records`);
//! Kafka 4.3.1 has neither KIP-1331 nor the tags.
