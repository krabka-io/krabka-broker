//! KIP-1071 streams-group in-memory state machine.
//!
//! This module mirrors the overall shape of the KIP-932 share-group state
//! machine (`super::super::share::state`): the `dirty` flag pattern,
//! `evict_expired`, `bump_epoch` and `install_target`. Streams members hold
//! *tasks* `(subtopology, partition)` across three disjoint roles, **active**,
//! **standby**, and **warmup**, instead of topic partitions.
//!
//! A new target changes no member. Each member reconciles toward it in its
//! own heartbeat, with Kafka's `CurrentAssignmentBuilder` rules
//! (`current_assignment`): a member revokes the tasks of every role before it
//! moves to the target epoch, and it gets a task only when no other member
//! still owns it and no other member of its process still runs it in another
//! role.
//!
//! A role's assignment is a `BTreeMap<String, Vec<i32>>`, from
//! `subtopology_id` to a sorted, deduped partition list. Everything here uses
//! that representation, so the state machine stays independent of any wire,
//! codec, or persistence newtype.
//!
//! This module is fully self-contained. It depends only on `std` and the
//! `uuid` crate, and it needs `uuid` only for the
//! [`StreamsMemberState::joining`] helper that synthesizes a random
//! `process_id`. It deliberately does NOT import the sibling `persistence`
//! module. The `i8` conversions on [`StreamsMemberAssignmentState`] live here,
//! so the actor can persist the state without coupling the two files.
//!
//! # Module layout
//!
//! This file is the module root. It holds the group-level state, meaning
//! [`StreamsGroupState`] and the epoch, membership, eviction, and target
//! transitions on it, plus the target assignment and the stored-topology
//! handle. Each child holds one concern: `member` the per-member state and its
//! reconciliation-state enum, `current_assignment` the reconciliation of one
//! member toward its target, `phase` the group lifecycle phase and its Kafka
//! group-state string, and `task_map` the normalization of a role's task map.
