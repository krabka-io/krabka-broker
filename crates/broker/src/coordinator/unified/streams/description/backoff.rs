//! Kafka's `StreamsGroupTopologyDescriptionBackoff`, for one group.
//!
//! When a heartbeat asks a member for the topology description, the broker
//! arms a window in which no other heartbeat of the group is asked for it at
//! the same topology epoch. Two members that join together therefore push the
//! description once, not twice. A push that succeeds clears the window. A
//! window that ends with no push behind it, because the member never sent one
//! or its push was lost, lets the next heartbeat ask again, and each
//! consecutive window at one epoch doubles, from 30 seconds to an hour, with
//! Kafka's 20% jitter.
//!
//! Kafka keeps the windows in one broker-wide map keyed by group id. The
//! group's streams actor keeps its own here, which forgets it when the group
//! is deleted, as Kafka's `DeleteGroups` does.
