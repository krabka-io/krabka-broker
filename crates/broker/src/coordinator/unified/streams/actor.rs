//! KIP-1071 streams-group coordinator actor: a per-group tokio task that drives
//! the heartbeat epoch exchange, reconciliation, and persistence.
//!
//! This actor mirrors the overall shape of the KIP-932 share-group actor
//! ([`super::super::share::actor`]): a `tokio::select!` loop over an mpsc
//! message channel plus a `heartbeat_interval` session tick, the
//! `Pending*Records` → `RecordBatch` → `OffsetsLog::append` flush, and a
//! last-known-good cache hand-off through
//! `GroupCoordinator::update_streams_cache`.
//!
//! Two things differ. This actor assigns *tasks* `(subtopology, partition)`
//! across the active, standby, and warmup roles instead of topic partitions.
//! It also reconciles against a full `MetadataImage` through the
//! [`MetadataSource`], which resolves the topology and creates internal
//! topics, instead of the consumer `MetadataProvider`.
//!
//! Reconciliation needs the coordinator's [`MetadataSource`]. The actor reads
//! it from the coordinator when it wakes, not when it starts: the
//! `__consumer_offsets` replay spawns the actors of the loaded groups before
//! the broker connects the source. The pure-coordinator unit tests have no
//! source, so the group stays `NotReady` with empty assignments. Members there
//! still mint a `member_id` and advance their epoch, but the actor assigns no
//! tasks.
