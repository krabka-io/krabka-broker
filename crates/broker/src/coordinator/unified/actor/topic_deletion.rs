//! The actor half of topic deletion: tombstone the offsets of deleted topics.

//! `coordinator::topic_deletion` watches the metadata image and sends the names
//! of the deleted topics to every group this broker coordinates. Kafka does the
//! same in `GroupCoordinatorService.onMetadataUpdate`, which schedules
//! `OffsetMetadataManager.onTopicsDeleted` on every coordinator shard.
