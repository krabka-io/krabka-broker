//! The resolution of the regular expressions that a consumer group's members
//! subscribe to: Kafka's `GroupMetadataManager.maybeUpdateRegularExpressions`
//! and `handleRegularExpressionsResult`.
//!
//! A member that subscribes to a regular expression gets the topics that the
//! group resolved the pattern to (see `consumer_state::regex`). The group
//! resolves a pattern when a member brings a new one, and refreshes every
//! resolution when a heartbeat finds them stale. Kafka runs the resolution as
//! an asynchronous task of the coordinator and writes its outcome when it
//! completes, in a batch of its own after the heartbeat's. Here the heartbeat
//! resolves in line, but the group applies and writes the outcome only after
//! the heartbeat's batch, as Kafka does, so the member that brought a pattern
//! is assigned its topics from its next heartbeat. The requesting member's
//! principal decides which matches the group keeps, as in Kafka.
//!
//! Each resolution is written as a `ConsumerGroupRegularExpression` record,
//! and a record is tombstoned when its last subscriber goes, so a coordinator
//! failover restores what every pattern resolved to.
