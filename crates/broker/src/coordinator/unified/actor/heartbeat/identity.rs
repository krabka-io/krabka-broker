//! Who a `ConsumerGroupHeartbeat` speaks for: the member-id, instance-id and
//! member-epoch rules of KIP-848 and KIP-345, as Kafka's
//! `GroupMetadataManager` applies them before it touches the group.
//!
//! Every function here is pure. It reads the group and the request and says
//! which member the heartbeat belongs to, or which error Kafka answers.
