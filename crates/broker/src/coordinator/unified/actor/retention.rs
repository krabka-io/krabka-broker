//! KIP-211 offset retention: the actor half of the sweep.
//!
//! `coordinator::retention` drives the cadence and decides which
//! groups this broker owns. This module answers the one question that needs
//! the group's own state, and it answers it inside the actor so a concurrent
//! join, commit, or leave cannot slip between the decision and the append.
//!
//! # What expires
//!
//! This follows Kafka's `OffsetMetadataManager.cleanupExpiredOffsets`. The
//! group's `offsetExpirationCondition` ([`expiration_condition`]) decides
//! whether any offset may expire and from which base. Only the offsets of a
//! topic the group does not subscribe to (`isSubscribedToTopic`) are
//! candidates, and an offset that an open transaction has written or is
//! about to write stays. So a live group loses the offsets of a topic it
//! stopped consuming, and keeps the ones it still consumes:
//!
//! - A classic group without a protocol type (a simple group that only
//!   commits) subscribes to nothing and measures from each commit.
//! - A memberless classic group subscribes to nothing and measures from the
//!   moment it went empty.
//! - A `Stable` classic group on the `consumer` protocol subscribes to the
//!   topics in its members' subscriptions and measures from each commit. In
//!   any other state, on any other protocol, or with a subscription Kafka
//!   cannot read, nothing expires.
//! - A KIP-848 group subscribes to its members' topic names and resolved
//!   regular expressions, and measures from each commit.
//!
//! Each candidate expires on its own clock, per
//! [`OffsetEntry::is_expired`](crate::coordinator::unified::classic_state::OffsetEntry::is_expired):
//! the per-commit `retention_time_ms` a v2-v4 `OffsetCommit` asked for, or
//! `offsets.retention.minutes` from the base the condition chose.
//!
//! # What the batch carries
//!
//! One tombstone for each expired offset, and — when the group is memberless,
//! has no open transaction and keeps no offset after the pass, including the
//! group that never held one and has been memberless for a whole sweep
//! interval — the group's own tombstone in the same batch, as Kafka's
//! `maybeDeleteGroup` appends it only for an empty group,
//! so a reader of `__consumer_offsets` never sees a group record with no
//! offsets and no members hanging behind a partial write. The group record is
//! the classic k2 `GroupMetadata` for a classic group, and the next-gen k3
//! `GroupMetadata` plus k6 `TargetAssignmentMetadata` for a KIP-848 group.
//! Deleting the group stops the actor; the coordinator drops the registry
//! entry when it reads [`ReapOutcome::group_deleted`].
