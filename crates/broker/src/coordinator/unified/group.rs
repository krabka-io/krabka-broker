//! Unified `Group` container for KIP-848 migration.
//!
//! One in-memory model for a consumer group, whichever protocol its members
//! speak.
//!
//! A `Group` is a discriminated container over the two existing, tested state
//! machines: the classic 5-state machine ([`ClassicState`]) and the next-gen
//! epoch machine ([`ConsumerState`]). The unified coordinator and the
//! persistence path can therefore hold either one behind a single type.
//!
//! The actor can change the live kind during KIP-848 upgrade and downgrade.
//! The container keeps both protocol-specific state machines behind one surface
//! so the coordinator and persistence code always use the live state.

// The state machines are reused verbatim, relocated under `unified/`. These
// aliases give the unified surface its types without renaming the moved code
// (the classic file keeps its internal `Group`/`GroupState` names).
