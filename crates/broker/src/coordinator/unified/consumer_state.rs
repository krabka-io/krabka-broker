//! Per-group state for KIP-848 next-gen consumer groups. Exactly one
//! `actor::GroupActor` task owns this state. It is never shared.
//!
//! This file is the module root. The [`MemberState`] record lives in
//! `member`, the [`GroupState`] container and its membership transitions in
//! `group`, the regular-expression subscriptions and what they resolved to in
//! `regex`, and the target-assignment reconciliation in `reconcile`.
//! [`TargetAssignment`] stays here: it is a leaf record with no behaviour of
//! its own.
