//! Classic-protocol per-`group_id` state machine (`Group`).
//!
//! This module holds pure data and transitions. The unified per-group actor
//! owns them. Committed offsets are protocol-agnostic and live on the unified
//! [`super::group::CoordinatorGroup`] container, not here.
//!
//! This file is the module root. The [`ClassicGroup`] record and its
//! rebalance-lifecycle transitions live in `group`, the membership transitions
//! in `membership`, the [`Member`] record in `member`, and the protocol vote in
//! `protocol`. [`OffsetEntry`] stays here: it is a leaf record with no
//! behaviour of its own.
