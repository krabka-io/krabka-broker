//! Metadata refresh of the groups that subscribe to a changed topic.
//!
//! Kafka's `GroupMetadataManager.onMetadataUpdate` runs on every metadata
//! image that the group coordinator applies. It collects the topics that the
//! image created, changed or deleted, and calls `requestMetadataRefresh` on
//! every group that subscribes to one of them (`groupsSubscribedToTopic`). The
//! next heartbeat of such a group computes its metadata hash again. When the
//! hash moved, that heartbeat bumps the group epoch and computes a new target
//! assignment. A member that subscribed to a topic before the topic existed
//! therefore gets its partitions at its next heartbeat. Kafka 4.3.1 has no
//! periodic refresh: `GroupMetadataManager.METADATA_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS` is
//! `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
//!
//! The image watcher of `coordinator::topic_deletion` reads every image,
//! finds the changed topics with [`changed_topics`], and sends them to the
//! groups with [`on_metadata_update`]. Each group actor decides whether it
//! subscribes to one of them.
//!
//! # Group kinds
//!
//! Kafka refreshes consumer, share and streams groups this way. A classic
//! group has nothing to refresh. Here the update goes to the consumer-group
//! actors. A share group computes its target assignment against the current
//! metadata on every heartbeat, and a streams group compares its metadata hash
//! on every heartbeat. Both therefore see a changed topic at their next
//! heartbeat without the update.
//!
//! # Only the coordinator refreshes
//!
//! Every broker watches the image, but a broker sends the update only to the
//! groups whose `__consumer_offsets` partition it leads. Kafka also applies an
//! image only to its active coordinator shards.
