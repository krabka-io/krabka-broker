/// Create `__krabka_audit` with one partition per registered broker at RF=1.
///
/// Broker-affinity: the i-th broker in ascending node-id order leads partition
/// `i`. Each broker therefore leads exactly one audit partition and writes to
/// it locally.
///
/// The function is idempotent. It treats a `TopicExists` error from the
/// controller as a success, because another node or a restart already created
/// the topic.
///
/// A node with the controller role submits the records only when it is the
/// quorum leader. A broker-only node never leads the quorum, so it submits its
/// own batch, which its metadata source forwards to the leader. Without that
/// path, a cluster with isolated controllers has no node that can place the
/// topic on a broker. The leader counts a topic that a pending batch creates
/// as an existing topic, so two racing submits create the topic once.
///
/// Only a registered broker gets a replica. Before any registration reaches
/// the image, the local node stands in for the broker list, but only when the
/// local node is a broker. A controller-only node hosts no replica. With no
/// registered broker, it submits nothing, and the first broker-only node to
/// start creates the topic.
///
/// After a submit, the function waits up to `audit_partition_wait_timeout` for
/// the topic to reach the local image. The audit pipeline reads that image
/// once, right after startup calls this function, to find the partition that
/// this broker leads.
///
/// The function returns `Ok(())` at once when `config.audit_enabled` is
/// `false`.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns [`BrokerError::Startup`] when the controller refuses the batch for
/// a reason other than an existing topic.
