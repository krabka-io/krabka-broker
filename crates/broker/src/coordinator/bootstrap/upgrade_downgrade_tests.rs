//! Tests for the group kind a replay settles on when a group moved between
//! the classic and the KIP-848 next-gen protocols.

//! leaves only the last value per key, so the tests pin both the compacted
//! residue that must replay as classic and the stray next-gen write that
//! resurrects the group as a consumer.
