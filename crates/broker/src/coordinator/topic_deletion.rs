//! Committed offsets of deleted topics.
//!
//! When the metadata image removes a topic, Kafka writes an `OffsetCommit`
//! tombstone for each offset of that topic in every group
//! (`GroupCoordinatorService.onMetadataUpdate`, which schedules
//! `OffsetMetadataManager.onTopicsDeleted` on every coordinator shard).
//! Without the tombstones a topic created again with the same name gets the
//! old offsets from `OffsetFetch`, and a consumer skips records or resets.
//!
//! This module watches the image and finds the deleted topics. Each group
//! actor decides which of its offsets to tombstone and appends the batch in
//! its own turn, so a concurrent commit cannot race the tombstone.
//!
//! # Only the coordinator writes
//!
//! Every broker watches the image, but a broker tombstones only the groups
//! whose `__consumer_offsets` partition it leads, the same ownership rule as
//! the offset-retention sweep.
