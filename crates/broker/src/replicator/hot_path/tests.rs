//! Tests for the replicator's benchmark seam.
//!
//! [`ReplicaSeam::spawn`] rebuilds a [`Partition`] by struct literal rather
//! than through `broker::partition_spawn`, because the production constructor
//! wants a broker, a log-dir registry and a diskless WAL the "what does the
//! extra `encoded_len` walk cost" question has no use for. That literal is the
//! seam's one real hazard: a `Partition` field added to production is a field
//! the seam has to be given a value for, and the value has to be the one
//! production picks.
//!
//! That already went wrong once. `marker_materialization` arrived on
//! `Partition` while this branch was out, and the seam only survived because
//! a missing field is a compile error. A field that *compiled* with the wrong
//! value would have gone through, and the benchmark would have carried on
//! reporting a number for a partition the broker never runs.
//!
//! So these tests stand the seam next to a partition the broker really spawns
//! and compare them: every field of the reconstruction in one projection, and
//! the bytes the two logs hold after replicating the same batches.
