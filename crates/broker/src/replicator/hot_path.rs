//! A benchmark seam over the replicator's per-batch work: the
//! `RecordBatch::encoded_len` walk it does for the replication-bytes metric,
//! and the [`Partition::replicate_batch`] call that carries the same batch to
//! the follower's log.
//!
//! The loop that runs these two steps in production
//! ([`super::response::handle_partition_response`]) also holds a leader
//! connection, a fetch session and a replication-target guard, none of which
//! the "what does the extra `encoded_len` walk cost" question depends on. This
//! module is the partition and its writer task with none of that, so
//! `benches/perf_deferrals.rs` can time the walk against the append it sits in
//! front of.
//!
//! [`ReplicaSeam::replicate`] is the production `replicate_batch`: the same
//! channel send to the same writer actor, which runs the same `append_at`.
