//! Outbound connections to a leader.
//!
//! The module holds the shared `ConnectionOptions` for every inter-broker call
//! a fetcher makes, the exponential reconnect schedule, and the retry loop that
//! dials the leader until it succeeds or the fetcher is cancelled.
//!
//! One connection serves every partition the fetcher follows on that leader,
//! so a leader restart costs one redial per fetcher rather than one per
//! partition -- the reconnect storm an operator used to see during a roll.
