//! The follower half of a KIP-227 incremental fetch session.
//!
//! Kafka's `ReplicaFetcherThread` folds every partition it owns into one
//! `FetchRequest` through a `FetchSessionHandler`. The first request of a
//! session is full: it names every partition and asks the leader to open a
//! session. Every later request is incremental: it names only the partitions
//! whose desired state changed, forgets the ones the follower stopped
//! following, and the leader answers with only the partitions whose state
//! changed on its side. A follower with ten thousand caught-up partitions
//! therefore sends an almost empty request per round instead of ten thousand
//! full ones.
//!
//! This is that handler. It is deliberately ignorant of what a partition is:
//! it takes the rows the caller wants sent this round, decides which of them
//! actually go on the wire, and tracks the session the leader granted.
//!
//! The leader half lives in [`crate::fetch_session`], and the two share the
//! wire sentinels: `(0, INITIAL_EPOCH)` opens a session, `(id, epoch)`
//! continues one, and a response `session_id` of
//! [`INVALID_SESSION_ID`](crate::fetch_session::INVALID_SESSION_ID) means the
//! leader granted none and every request stays full.
