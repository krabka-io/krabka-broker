//! The clean-shutdown proof a broker leaves behind, and reads back on its next
//! start.
//!
//! A broker that stops gracefully writes its current broker epoch to
//! `{log_dir}/clean_shutdown`. The next start reads that epoch and offers it
//! back at registration; the controller accepts the restart as clean only when
//! the epoch it still holds for that node is the one the file names.
//! A broker that died -- SIGKILL, a lost machine, a panic -- wrote no file, so
//! it can prove nothing and its restart is unclean.
//!
//! This is Kafka's `previousBrokerEpoch`.
//! `CleanShutdownFileHandler` in `kafka-storage-4.3.1.jar` writes
//! `.kafka_cleanshutdown` into each log dir on an orderly stop,
//! `LogManager.readBrokerEpochFromCleanShutdownFiles` reads it at startup, and
//! `ClusterControlManager.registerBroker` computes
//! `isCleanShutdown = storedBrokerEpoch == request.previousBrokerEpoch()`.
//! krabka writes the same bytes as Kafka,
//! `{"version":0,"brokerEpoch":<epoch>}`, in the field order Jackson gives
//! `CleanShutdownFileHandler.Content`, but keeps its own file name,
//! `clean_shutdown`, rather than Kafka's `.kafka_cleanshutdown`.
//!
//! ## Absent means unclean
//!
//! Every read failure -- no file, an unreadable file, a file that is not the
//! JSON above, a version this build does not know -- answers [`UNPROVEN`],
//! which no real broker epoch can equal, so it never compares clean. This is
//! the one place the on-disk contract does not refuse an unknown version:
//! Kafka's `CleanShutdownFileHandler.read` turns every read failure into
//! `OptionalLong.empty()`, which `LogManager` reports as `-1`, and an unclean
//! restart is the safe answer. It costs this node its ELR membership for one
//! restart (KIP-966) and nothing else, whereas a hard error would keep a node
//! from starting over a single-use file whose absence is already a valid
//! state. krabka is stricter than Kafka in one direction only: Kafka reads the
//! epoch of any version it can parse, and krabka reads only
//! [`FORMAT_VERSION`].
//!
//! Kafka takes the same default from two directions at once:
//! `previousBrokerEpoch` defaults to `-1` on the wire, and the controller
//! passes `cleanShutdownDetectionEnabled = false` for any `BrokerRegistration`
//! older than v3, which forces the comparison to `false` outright. A
//! controller that cannot prove clean assumes unclean.
//!
//! ## The proof is spent on use
//!
//! [`take`] deletes the file as it reads it. The proof covers exactly one
//! restart: a broker that starts, registers, and then dies has consumed it, so
//! the start after that one finds nothing and is unclean, which is the truth.
//! Kafka deletes the same file while `LogManager` loads the log dir.
