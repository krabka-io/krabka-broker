//! A broker's fencing and controlled-shutdown state in the metadata log.
//!
//! Kafka keeps both on the broker registration. `RegisterBrokerRecord` writes
//! a new registration fenced (the schema default), and every later change is
//! a `BrokerRegistrationChangeRecord` for the same broker epoch:
//! `ReplicationControlManager.handleBrokerFenced`, `handleBrokerUnfenced` and
//! `handleBrokerInControlledShutdown` write one, and
//! `ClusterControlManager.replay` applies it to the registration.
//! `KRaftMetadataCache.isReplicaOffline` then reads `fenced()` back on
//! whichever broker serves the request.
//!
//! Krabka writes the same records. [`registration_change`] builds the
//! `BrokerRegistrationChangeRecord` of one transition for the broker's current
//! epoch. It applies only while the broker is still registered at that epoch:
//! the controller drops a change whose broker registered again after it was
//! built, and the image ignores one it replays at another epoch, so a stale
//! change never touches the new registration. A new registration carries
//! broker epoch -1, and the controller stamps it.
//!
//! The heartbeat handler writes the fence, unfence and controlled-shutdown
//! transitions of Kafka's heartbeat state machine. The liveness ticker writes
//! the fence of a broker whose session expired, as
//! `ReplicationControlManager.maybeFenceOneStaleBroker` does:
//! [`publish_fencing_changes`] runs on the controller leader at every tick and
//! is level-triggered, so a broker that stays dead costs one record, not one
//! per tick. Only a heartbeat unfences, as in Kafka.
