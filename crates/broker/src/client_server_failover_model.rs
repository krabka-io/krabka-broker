//! Bounded stateright model composing producer-client failover routing with the
//! broker-side idempotent-producer dedup check.
//!
//! # Module layout
//!
//! This file is the module root. It declares the children and holds the one
//! test that runs the checker. Each child holds one concern: [`bounds`] the
//! bounded cluster and client shape, [`witness`] the bitset that keeps the
//! `sometimes` properties honest, [`state`] the search space and the pure
//! queries over it, [`produce`] one client produce attempt against the real
//! `check_pure`, [`properties`] what the checker proves, [`model`] the
//! stateright [`Model`](stateright::Model) implementation, and [`runner`] the
//! checker bounds.

// Each child is declared with an explicit `#[path]`. The declaration then names
// the same file whether or not this root is itself reached through a `#[path]`.
