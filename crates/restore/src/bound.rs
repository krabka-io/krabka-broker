//! The restore bound: every predicate an operator gave, and what it decides.
//!
//! This module owns the point in time the restore stops at. It compiles the
//! `--to-offset`, `--to-timestamp`, `--exclude-key`, `--exclude-header`,
//! `--exclude-producer-id`, and `--exclude-offset` flags into one predicate
//! set, and answers two questions about the archived bytes. For a batch it
//! answers whether the batch passes through untouched, must be replaced with
//! a bare header because every record is excluded, or has to be re-encoded
//! because only some of its records survive; the borrowed batch view makes
//! that decision without an owned decode of the batches that pass. Dropping a
//! batch's bytes is never the same as dropping its offset range: the target
//! log permits compacted offset gaps, but a rewrite must preserve the archived
//! batch span: it also determines the producer's last sequence and the
//! partition's exclusive end. A batch whose records are all excluded therefore
//! still claims its original offsets as a bare header. For one record inside
//! a batch that must be re-encoded, it answers whether the record survives. The exclude
//! patterns match the raw key and header bytes. This module decodes no
//! payload and knows no schema.
