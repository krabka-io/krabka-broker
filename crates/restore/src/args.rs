//! The `krabka restore` command line and the parsers for its compound values.
//!
//! Every flag is long-form. The target-side flags carry the same names as
//! `krabka format`, because a restore formats the cluster it writes into and an
//! operator must not have to learn two spellings for one concept.
//!
//! The flags are grouped into three flattened structs, one per stage of the
//! command: where the archive is, what the target cluster is, and what the
//! restore keeps. `#[command(flatten)]` keeps every flag top-level, so the
//! grouping shows up in `--help` as headings and nowhere else.
//!
//! This file holds the clap definition itself. The values those flags take, and
//! the parsers clap calls to build them, live in `value` and `timestamp`, and
//! the cross-flag checks clap cannot express live in `validate`.
