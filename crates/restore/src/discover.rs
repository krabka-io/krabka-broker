//! The archive inventory: what the archive holds, before anything is read.
//!
//! This module owns the scan. It streams the archive listing under the
//! operator's prefix, decodes every key with the KIP-405 archive key codec
//! (`parse_partition_dir_name` and `parse_segment_file_name`), and groups
//! the result into one [`SegmentInventory`] per archived segment, with the
//! object key and size of each artifact that is present. The listing is
//! consumed as it arrives, so the scan holds one entry per archived segment
//! rather than one per object: an archive of tens of millions of keys is
//! exactly the archive a restore runs against. It keeps the keys it cannot
//! attribute rather than discarding them, because an unrecognized key is the
//! first sign that `--archive-prefix` points at the wrong tree, and it keeps a
//! bounded sample with a count of the rest, because a wrong prefix makes every
//! key in the bucket unrecognized. When
//! `--rlmm-snapshot` is given, this module reconciles the scan against it and
//! reports a disagreement instead of choosing a winner; without the snapshot a
//! segment the old cluster had marked for deletion looks exactly like a live
//! one. This module decides nothing about completeness or integrity. It
//! reports presence, and the verify stage judges it.
//!
//! This file holds the scan itself and the shapes it produces. The
//! snapshot comparison, which is the only part with a second source of truth to
//! weigh, lives beside it in [`self::reconcile`].
