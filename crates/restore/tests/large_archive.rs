//! The archive scan against a bucket far larger than the machine that runs
//! the restore.
//!
//! A tiered cluster archives six objects per segment per partition, so a year
//! of a busy cluster is tens of millions of keys, and `krabka restore` is run
//! precisely when that cluster is gone and the operator has whatever laptop is
//! to hand. The scan therefore consumes the listing as it arrives and keeps
//! only per-segment state plus a bounded sample of the keys it cannot
//! attribute. This suite drives it against a synthetic store that yields a
//! million objects without ever holding them, which no on-disk fixture could
//! do, and reads the process's own peak resident set to show the scan did not
//! grow with the listing.
