//! The client-visible half of the round trip: a broker booted on a restore
//! output answers `ListOffsets`, `Fetch` and `OffsetForLeaderEpoch` the way
//! KFC-3 says it must, and keeps answering after a restart.
//!
//! `partition_data.rs` proves the restored bytes are right by reopening the
//! directory with a fresh `krabka_log::Log`. That is the storage layer talking
//! to itself. This file is the same claim made where it is actually promised
//! -- "Offsets Are the Contract" and "Leader Epochs Come Back Through the
//! Batches" in `docs/KFCs/KFC-3-point-in-time-restore.md` -- so every
//! assertion here is a wire answer from a running broker:
//!
//! * `ListOffsets EARLIEST` returns the archive's first surviving offset, and
//!   `payments-1`, whose oldest archived segment begins at offset 2, is what
//!   keeps that from passing by returning a hard-coded zero.
//! * `ListOffsets LATEST` returns the archive's end offset, so the restored
//!   high watermark is the archived one and not zero.
//! * `Fetch` from earliest returns the archived batches, compared as whole
//!   `RecordBatch` values against [`PartitionFixture::expected_batches`], so a
//!   batch that came back at a shifted offset or with a rewritten header fails
//!   here.
//! * `OffsetForLeaderEpoch` for the epoch the archived batches carry answers
//!   with that epoch's end offset rather than the `-1` a partition with no
//!   epoch history gives, which is the answer a KIP-320 consumer needs to
//!   validate its position instead of resetting it.
//!
//! One case is deliberately absent. Every partition here archives at leader
//! epoch 0, which is also the epoch the restore seeds each `PartitionRecord`
//! with, so an archive whose batches sit ABOVE the restored metadata epoch is
//! untested -- today the broker answers `UNKNOWN_LEADER_EPOCH` for it. See the
//! Test Plan in `docs/KFCs/KFC-3-point-in-time-restore.md`.
//!
//! The restart case then shuts the broker down, starts another on the same
//! directory, and repeats the fetch -- the second boot replays an already
//! populated `__cluster_metadata` rather than seeding one, which nothing else
//! exercises. Producing one batch into the restarted broker and finding it at
//! the archived end offset is what proves the restored high watermark seeded
//! the next append rather than merely being reported.
