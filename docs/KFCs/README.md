# KFCs

A KFC is a **Kall for Comment**: the krabka record of a change that alters observable broker behaviour where no Kafka KIP covers it.

Apache Kafka changes its public behaviour through a KIP. A KIP states the motivation, the public interfaces, the proposed change, the compatibility story, and the alternatives the authors rejected. krabka follows a KIP wherever one exists, and the KIP stays the specification for that feature.

Some krabka work has no KIP to follow. A capability that Kafka never accepted is one example. A config that changes what a consumer sees is another. Each of them changes what a client observes, and no upstream document explains it. A KFC is the document for that case. It carries the same sections as a KIP, in the same order, so a reader who knows KIPs can read one without a second explanation.

A KFC is a design record, not a manual. It explains why the broker behaves in a new way. It does not repeat the API reference that the rustdoc carries, and it does not repeat the test detail that the coverage report carries.

## When a Change Needs a KFC

Write a KFC before you merge a change that does one of these things:

- **A new client-visible semantic.** A consumer, a producer, or an admin tool sees an outcome that Kafka does not define. Delayed visibility of a produced record is one example.
- **A new topic config or broker config that changes delivery.** A setting that changes which records a fetch returns, in what order, or at what time is a change of contract for every client of that topic.
- **A deliberate divergence from Kafka.** krabka answers a request in a way that the JVM broker does not, and the difference is a decision rather than a defect.

The test is what a client can observe. If a stock Kafka client can tell the difference, and no KIP explains the difference, the change needs a KFC.

## When a Change Does Not Need a KFC

- **An internal refactor.** New module boundaries, a new data structure, or a new task layout change nothing that a client sees.
- **A bug fix.** A fix that moves krabka back towards Kafka's documented behaviour needs a test, not a KFC.
- **An implementation of an existing KIP.** The KIP is the specification. Track the work against the KIP and record the interpretation decisions in the subsystem design doc.

A change that needs a subsystem design doc does not automatically need a KFC. The two documents answer different questions. A [design doc](../style_guides/design_doc_style_guide.md) explains how a subsystem works. A KFC explains why the broker's contract with its clients changed.

## File Names

Each KFC is one file, named `KFC-<n>-<slug>.md`.

The number `<n>` is the next free integer. Numbers run in order of creation and a number is never reused. The slug is the title in lower case with hyphens between the words. `KFC-1-deliver-at-time-visibility.md` is the first one.

A KFC file stays in the tree after the decision, whatever the decision was. A rejected KFC is a useful record, because it stops the same proposal from coming back without new arguments.

## Required Sections

Every KFC carries these headings, in this order. The order is the Apache Kafka KIP order.

| Section | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| Status | The current status value, and the branch or release that carries the implementation. |
| Motivation | The problem, and why the broker is the right place to solve it. |
| Public Interfaces | Every config, error code, metric, and wire element that a client or an operator sees. |
| Proposed Changes | The design and the reasons behind it. This is the longest section. |
| Compatibility, Deprecation, and Migration Plan | What breaks, what does not, and what an operator has to do. |
| Test Plan | How the project proves the design is correct. Name the test tiers, do not copy them. |
| Rejected Alternatives | Each alternative in its own subsection, with the reason for the rejection. |

The Rejected Alternatives section is not decoration. Most readers arrive with an obvious design already in mind. They go to that section first, and the reason has to be there.

## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Draft` | The author still works on the document. The design can still change. |
| `Under discussion` | The document is open for comment. No code depends on it yet. |
| `Adopted` | The project accepted the design. The Status section names the branch or the release that carries the implementation. |
| `Rejected` | The project decided against the design. The document stays in the tree with the reason. |
| `Superseded` | A later KFC replaces this one. The Status section names it. |

## Style

A KFC follows the [design doc style guide](../style_guides/design_doc_style_guide.md) for content and the [prose style guide](../style_guides/prose_style_guide.md) for wording. The reader knows Kafka and distributed systems, and may know little Rust. Explain the decision, not the code.
